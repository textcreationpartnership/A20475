         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And as he is not aſhamed to lie in this point ſo doth he alſo in ſaying that in England all were Papiſts, without exception, from the firſt chriſtening thereof vntill this age of king Henrie the eight: yet Miniſters were married many hundred yeares in England, as <hi>M. Camden</hi> ſheweth in his <hi>Britannia</hi> in many places. In the 129. page of the third edition he prooueth that <hi>ante annum 1102. ſacerdotibus vxores in Anglia non fuerunt interdictae,</hi> Miniſters were not reſtrained from marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age before the yeare of our Lord a <hi>1102.</hi> And as Miniſters were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, ſo Tranſubſtantiation was not acknowledged likewiſe a long time, as may be ſeene by <hi>Aelfricus</hi> his epiſtle againſt the bodily preſence. Moreouer, the author as he laboureth to diſgrace all Proteſtants in generall, ſo eſpecially he inueyeth against <hi>Luther,</hi> wherefore to ſtoppe the mouthes of Papiſts, I will ſet downe the teſtimonie of <hi>Langius</hi> a Papiſt concerning <hi>Luther.</hi> Firſt he ſaith, that he was <hi>vir venerandus &amp; profundiſſimus Theologus,</hi> a reuerend man and moſt profound Diuine. Afterward he writeth thus, <hi>Martinus ille theologorum noſtrae tempeſtatis omnium facile princeps doctrinam ſuam E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicis teſtimoniis &amp; divi Apoſtoli Pauli necnon priſcorum orthodoxorum patrum originalibus dictis roborans &amp; compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans perſtitit invictus.</hi> The ſame Martin the moſt wiſe ringleader of the diuines of our age, confirming and ſtrengthening his doctrine with teſtimonies, out of the Goſpel and out of S. Paul the Apoſtle, and alſo with the originall ſayings of the ancient orthodoxall fathers, perfisted invincible. This teſtimonie may ſuffice to cleare Luther from the friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous quarrels that this ſlanderer hath written against him. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maketh the confeſſion of the aduerſe part to be a note of the Church. Hence then are we prooued the Church by this confeſſion of Langius. The ſame author exceedingly commendeth <hi>Hierome</hi> of <hi>Prage,</hi> ſaying that he was <hi>orator eloquentiſſimus atque acerrimus dialecticus adeo quod nullus doctiſſimorum virorum in Concilio diſputan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do eum ſuperare poterat.</hi> He was the moſt eloquent Orator, and fine Logician that the learnedeſt man in the Councell could not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him in diſputation. <hi>Mutius</hi> his teſtimonie of the ſame man is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie

Now what cauſe this proud Papiſt hath to vaunt of their owne learning, and to diſgrace the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, let euery man iudge; ſeeing Proteſtants by the Papists owne confeſſion haue beene ſuch famous men. Laſtly, not to be long, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this booke extolleth the holineſſe of their religion: touching which point let that ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t writer <hi>Aronobius</hi> ſpeak, who in his ſeuenth booke hath this ſentence, <hi>Creſcit multitudo peccantium cum redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendi peccati ſpes datur &amp; facile itur ad culpas vbi eſt vaenalis ignoſcentium gratia.</hi> Sinners doe much encreaſe when there is hope giuen to redeeme their ſinnes, and men eaſily commit faults where par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons are ſold.

S. Peter ſpeaketh of the hope that is in them, not out of them, in themſelues, not in another. In a word, to ſay they beleeue as the Church beleeueth, is an anſwer fit for all heretikes. Furthermore, out of this place of S. Peter, we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Chriſtian men haue a hope in them, yet Pope Iohn the 23. denied the immortalitie of the ſoule.

            <p>I denie the aſſumption againe, for expoſition of which place of holy writ,<note place="margin">in hunc locum.</note> I produce Auguſtine, who writeth thus. <hi>Quae omnia? niſi ex quibus Ille eijcitur foras. non autem dixit omnes, ſed omnia, non enim omnium est ſides.</hi> What all but thoſe out of which Sathan is caſt? he ſaid not all men, but all things, for all men haue not faith. Againe Auguſtine writeth thus. <hi>Aut ſi omnia, ipſi homines intelligendi ſunt, omnia praedeſtinata ad ſalutem poſſumus dicere.</hi> If by all things all men are meant, we may vnderſtand all the predeſtinate vnto ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Your other Scriptures foretell the calling of the Gentiles, which we confeſſe. To proceede in this argument, was not Chriſt true in his promiſe, when as Act. 1.15. the Church was but about a hundred and twentie ſoules? here is no great number, and yet this ſmall number was in a chamber. In the 13. of the Reuel. v. 3. the whole earth wondered at the beaſt, yet is Chriſt true in his promiſe. In your Apologie of Engliſh fugitiues, thus you ſhall finde it written. The whole world did runne from Chriſt after Iulian to plaine Paganiſme, after Valens to Arrianiſme. The Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts vpon the ſecond of the Theſſalonians, acknowledge a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolt from the Church. Nazianzen in his oration of Cyprian ſaith, that <hi>Cyprianus in temporibus Decij ſolus è Chriſtianis est relictus.</hi> S.

I may ſpeake therefore of this Doctor, as Tullie doth to one, <hi>Ea in alterum ne dicas, quae cum tibi reſponſa ſunt, erubeſcas:</hi> vtter not theſe things againſt another, which when they are anſwered, will make thee aſhamed. Now I come to vntruths which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouched in this chapter. Firſt, he chargeth vs that we affirme, that almoſt all nations haue beene in Lucifer his thraldome vntill this our age in which Luther came to expell Lucifer. Secondly he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that in our countrey of England, it is moſt manifeſt, that all were Papiſts without exception, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the firſt chriſtening there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vntill this age of king Henrie the eight. M. Doctor, haue you loſt your forehead? was Iohn Wickliff a Papiſt? I perſwade my ſelfe you dare not affirme it. Againe, this land receiued the faith in the Apoſtles time, as witneſſeth <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his book againſt the Iewes. But the Apoſtles preached not Poperie. Did the Apoſtles teach the halfe communion? who but blind would affirme it? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, in Pope Gregories time, this land differed in ceremonies, &amp; in celebration of the Maſſe from Rome, as<note n="b" place="margin">2. 2. 93 quaeſt, art. 1. arg. 3.</note> Aquinas teacheth: who liſt to read more of this point, may be referred vnto D.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19042:6"/> cauill of the Doctor againſt our religion, for I paſſe by the title that he giueth to Lucifer calling him the maſter deuill. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of deuills I leaue to Papiſts to ſet forth, who are ſometimes too familiar with them,<note place="margin">Taſc. temp.</note> as Silveſter, who was made Pope by the helpe of the deuill.</p>
            <p>Luther his ſpeach concerning the reſtoring of the Goſpel, muſt be vnderſtood comparatiuely: the Goſpel was before his time, but it was not, <hi>in tanta luce,</hi> in ſuch brightnes, as it hath beene ſince, and I truſt it ſhall more and more increaſe <hi>ingratijs Papiſtarum,</hi> whether the Papiſts will or no. They may preſſe the truth, but they ſhall neuer oppreſſe it: they may vaunt of veritie, but they muſt winne the cauſe by force of arguments.</p>

            </list>
            <p>The propoſition is falſe. Salvianus in the beginning of his 4. booke of prouidence, ſpeaketh excellently of this point. <hi>Nomen ſine officio nihil est. nam ſicut ait quidam in ſcriptis ſuis, quid eſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patus, ſine meritorum ſublimitate, niſi honoris titulus ſine nomine.</hi> A name without the dutie is nothing, for as one faith in his writings, what is principalitie without ſublimitie of good works, but a bare title of honour. For the further handling of this matter, we will conſider what Catholike is. Vincentius Lyrinenſis thus deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth this word Catholike. <hi>Quod ab omnibus creditum eſt, Catholicum eſt:</hi> that which is beleeued of all men is Catholike. Is Poperie then Catholike, which is not beleeued of all men? I will name ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions and prooue them not to be credited of all, and I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne with the worſhipping of Images, which I will prooue not to be Catholike. <hi>Minutius Foelix</hi> in his <hi>Octauius</hi> ſpeaketh thus, <hi>Cruces nec colimus, nec optamus,</hi> we neither worſhip, nor wiſh for Croſſes Againe in the ſame treatiſe, it is demanded of Chriſtians, <hi>Cur nullas aras habent, templa nulla, nulla nota ſimulachra?</hi> why they haue no altars, no temples, no images? The Councell of Eliberis
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19042:6"/> in Spaine, haue in plaine words baniſhed them out of Churches. <hi>Placuit picturas in Eccleſiis eſſe non debere, ne quod colitur aut adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, in parietibus depingatur.</hi> We haue decreed that pictures ought not to be in the Churches, leaſt that which is worſhipped or ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, be painted on walls. <hi>Sigebert</hi> in the yeare of our Lord 755. writeth, that <hi>Conſtantinus Jmperator Conſtantinopoli ſynodum trecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum triginta Epiſcoporum congregat; in qua edicto promulgato, de I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginibus Dei &amp; ſanctorum eius deponendis, Eccleſiam Dei nimis ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalizat.</hi> Conſtantine the Emperour gathered a Councell at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople of 330. Biſhops in which, publiſhing an edict againſt the Images of God and the Saints, he doth too much ſcandalize the Church. Thus it appeareth that worſhipping of Images is not Catholike.</p>
            <p>Secondly the Papiſts teach, that the Church is built vpon vpon Peters perſon. Is this Catholike doctrine? Ionas in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke of Images ſpeaketh thus of this point, <hi>Multi &amp; penè omnes, Petram, ſuper quam aedificatur Eccleſia fidem intelligunt beati Petri, quae communis eſt totius ſanctae Eccleſiae, videlicet eam quae paulò ante promiſſionem hanc praeceſſerat, id eſt, tu es Chriſtus filius Dei vivi.</hi> Many and almoſt all vnderſtand by the Rocke, on which the Church is built, the faith of bleſſed Peter, which is common to all the holy Church, namely that which a little before was precedent to this promiſe, that is to ſay, Thou art Chriſt the ſonne of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly the Papiſts teach, that the virgin Marie was no ſinner: is this catholike doctrine? Read Aquinas in his third part, the 27. quaeſt. the 4. art. and his anſwer to the third argument, where reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Chryſoſtomes authoritie, he ſaith, that <hi>exceſſit in illis verbis,</hi> his words are too broad, yet many yeares after Chryſoſtome was this doctrine held.<note place="margin">in 22. Math.</note> Theophilact writeth that Marie was <hi>ambitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſula, tanto ſibi filio ſubdito,</hi> ſomewhat ambitious, hauing ſuch a ſonne vnder her.</p>
            <p>Fourthly the Papiſts teach, that Miniſters may not haue wiues: is this catholike? many hundred yeares after Chriſt, Prieſts were married. In the yeare of our Lord 1074. Hildebrand (as Lamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Schafuaburgenſis reporteth) decreed that, <hi>Habentes aut dimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, aut deponantur,</hi> they which had wiues muſt either diſmiſſe them or be depoſed: therefore, ſaith the forenamed writer, <hi>Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus hoc decretum infremunt tota factio Clericorum,</hi> the whole compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19042:7"/> of the Cleargie ſtormed againſt this decree. The ſame is alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Sigebert, ſaying that Gregorie <hi>vxorates Sacerdotes à di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino officio removit novo exemplo,</hi> remooued from diuine ſeruice the married Prieſts by a new example. What ſhould I ſpeake of prayer in a ſtrange tongue, of concealing the Scriptures from the people, of ſummoning of Councells by the Pope? Theſe with many other opinions, might I ſhew to be againſt diuinitie taught in the ancient Church. Pacianus thus deſcribeth Catholike, that it is <hi>Obedientia omnium mandatorum, ſcilicet Dei:</hi> an obedience vnto all Gods commandements. Now let vs ſee whether you teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience vnto Gods commandements or no? to let paſſe Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie and other ſinnes,<note place="margin">M. Perk. ex Molano. See more of this point in the Reaſon of doctrine.</note> I come to ſwearing. The Papiſts teach that they may ſweare that they haue not beene at Maſſe, when they haue beene there. This is nothing but to prophane an oath as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas teſtifieth, in his 2. 2. 89. quaeſt. art. 7. and anſwer to the 4. ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, ſaying, <hi>Quacun<expan>

            <p>Let vs now heare the reaſon why the name Catholike prooueth a Church; becauſe they that are ſo named, haue on their ſide Scriptures, Fathers, Councells, and Martyrs: (for of miracles we ſhall ſpeake hereafter.) This proud bragge I vtterly denie: &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Scriptures, I ſay with Salvianus in his 5. booke of proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that <hi>Nos tantùm Scripturas plenas habemus, qui eas vel in fonte ſuo bibimus, vel certè de puriſſimo fonte hauſtas:</hi> we onely haue the Scriptures fully perfect, which either drinke them in their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, or tranſlated out of a moſt pure fountaine. Touching Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by that which hath bin ſaid afore, it appeareth that they are not all on their ſide. What ſhould I ſpeake of the famous Martyrs in Queene Maries daies, which died in the religion now taught in England? Thus therefore I returne the argument:</p>
            <list type="syllogism">
               <item>They which are falſly called Catholikes, are not the true church:</item>

I cannot let paſſe his ignorance in ſaying, that all heretikes haue alwaies taken their names of ſome one, who began that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. For (not to take exception againſt his ſpeach) by the firſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of hereſie, as Neſtorius, Pelagius, euery meane diuine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that many heretikes haue their names of their hereſie, not of their author, as <hi>Apoſtolici, Cathari,</hi> and others. If the Lutherans haue changed the word <hi>Catholike</hi> in the Creede, draw your penne againſt them, and not againſt the church of England. But it is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous matter for ſome of our tranſlations to ſay, for an heretike, a man that is the author of ſects.<note place="margin">His owne men ſo tranſlate the word here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Act. 24. chap. &amp; 28. chap.</note> A great matter to engliſh a greeke word. Thankes be to God, that you haue no other cauills againſt our tranſlations. I hope ſuch pelting will driue men from Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Your ſaying out of Hierome galleth your ſelues, and prooueth you to be ſectaries, as beeing named Dominicans, Franciſcans, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, and with diuers other names. Therfore pleaſe not your ſelues any longer with a bare name, without the ſubiect matter: for that is like a pearle in the ſnowt of a ſwine.</p>

            <p>Bluſh M.

Some Papiſts hold Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet to be Antichriſt, Bellarmine in his 3. booke <hi>de Rom. Pont. cap.</hi> 3. This is denied by other, becauſe, ſay they, Antichriſt ſhall be one ſingular man.</p>
            <p>Secondly ſome Papiſts teach, that Antichriſt ſhall ariſe of the tribe of Dan:<note place="margin">cap. 11.</note> yet Bellarmine confeſſeth that this opinion is not certaine, becauſe no ſcripture conuinceth it.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:19042:8"/>
            <p>Thirdly the Papiſts teach, that Antichriſt ſhall raigne but three yeares and an halfe, yet Hentenius confuteth this opinion.</p>
            <p>Fourthly ſome Papiſts teach, that Antichriſt ſhall vtterly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the faith, as I prooued before. Bellarmine denieth this not without cauſe.</p>
            <p>Fifthly the Rhemiſts ſay, that it may well be that Antichriſt ſhall ſit at Rome. Bellarmine will haue him to ſit at Ieruſalem. I will not follow any more contradictions about this opinion, but come to their vnitie in Idolatrie.</p>
            <p>Catharine affirmeth the commandement which concerneth I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages to be temporall and poſitiue: is not this goodly diuinitie? others denie it. Caietan confoundeth an Idol and an Image, Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine cannot beare this doctrine. Aquinas will haue the croſſe of Chriſt to be worſhipped with diuine honour, others renounce Aquinas in this point. Alphonſus de Caſtro counteth Serenus and Epiphanius enemies to Images, Bellarmine confuteth Alphonſus his opinion. Abulenſis and Pereſius teach, that Images of God are not to be made: Bellarmine like an Idolater alloweth Images of God himſelfe. Auguſtine ſpeaketh plainly againſt this diueliſh diuinitie. <hi>Nulla Imago Dei coli debet niſi illa quae hoc eſt, quod ipſe, nec ipſa pro illo,</hi>

            <p>Secondly the Doctor fearing leaſt our Church ſhould flouriſh and dilate it ſelfe, affirmeth that the Church is now old, &amp; to make her flouriſh in her old age is to make her a monſter.

Indeede thankes be to God, our Church now is ample, as teſtifie England, Scotland, Denmarke, Suetia, Saxonie, Helvetia, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countries, and therefore the Doctour varieth in this point. But that Antichriſt ſhall be reuealed, and the Church increaſe, it is plaine out of the 2. Theſſ. 2. where Paul propheſieth, that the <hi>Lord ſhall conſume him with the ſpirit of his mouth.</hi> This to be done we ſee it daily with our eyes, for by the preaching of the Goſpel Antichriſt is continually leſſened. Moreouer in this reaſon the Doctour affirmeth, that perſecution of any moment is not againſt Papiſts, but onely in England. The perſecution of Papiſts in England is for treaſon, as their owne writings teſtifie. The title of the booke is this, Important co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderations which ought to mooue all true Catholikes to acknowledge that the proceedings of her Maieſtie ſince the beginning of her highnes raigne, haue bin both mild and mercifull. The Rhemiſts are contrarie to this Doctour, for they writing vpon the 20. of the Rev. affirme Catholikes to be perſecuted not onely in England, but alſo in Scotland, Flaunders, and other places: thus well heretikes agree amongſt themſelues.

But the Doctour deſireth to be told whether againſt all learned Phyſitians, and againſt all Lawyers, one or two of later yeares are to be credited. I anſwer, if they haue the truth on their ſides, they are. Might not Michaiah haue beene poſed with this queſtion, who was but one againſt foure hundred prophets?

            <p>M.

True miracles ſay you, were neuer wrought but by them, which were of the true religion: for that they are done onely by the power of God. The Rhemiſts vpon the 9. of Marke are of another minde: for thus they write; Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are wrought ſometimes by the name of Ieſus, whatſoeuer the man be, when it is for the proofe of truth, or for the glorie of God: inſomuch that Iulian the Apoſtata himſelfe did driue away deuills with the ſigne of the croſſe, as Gregorie Nazianzen writeth, orat. in Iulian. Theodo. lib. 3. cap. 3. hiſt. and ſo heretikes may doe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles among the heathen. If miracles may be done by heretikes, they are then not alwaies done by thoſe which are of the true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, except heretikes be of the true religion. Thus your owne men, M. Doctour, driue you to the wall. Socrates in his 7. booke and 17. chap. reporteth a miracle done by Paulus a Novatian Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop: <hi>Iudaeus quidam veteratus Chriſtianam fidem ſimulans, ſaepius baptizatus fuit, per quam fallaciam multas pecunias corraſit:</hi> a certaine Iewe beeing an olde deceiuer and counterfeiting Chriſtian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was diuers times baptized, by which deceit he gathered much money: in the ende when he ſhould be baptized by Paulus, <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſa aqua divina quadam virtute quae oculis cerni non poterat ſubitò exhauſta eſt.</hi> all the water by Gods power which could not be ſeene, ſuddenly vaniſhed away.

Where you ſay miracles are done onely by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God: if you ſpeake exactly of miracles, I ioyne with you: for as the ſame Aquinas teacheth in his 110. queſt. that is properly a miracle which is done <hi>praetor ordinem totius naturae creatae,</hi> aboue all power that is created. When God worketh ſuch miracles by falſe prophets and heretikes, he doth it to trie men, as Moſes ſpeaketh in the 13. of Deut. <hi>If there ariſe among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreames, and giue thee a ſigne or a wonder, and the ſigne come to paſſe, thou ſhalt not hearken vnto the words of the prophet: for the Lord your God prooueth you, to know whether you loue the Lord your God with all your heart or no.</hi> Out of this place it is plaine that God will trie his ſeruants, ſometimes by wonders, and therfore they are not alwaies done to confirme true religion.

Bellarmine in his 2. booke of purgatorie and 7. chap. alleadgeth a viſion out of Beda, to prooue beſides hell, purgatorie, and heauen, a fourth place, namely, <hi>pratum florentiſſimum dilucidiſſimum,</hi> as it were a moſt goodly meadow.

To proceede. You ſay whoſoeuer were condemned by Councells confirmed by the See Apoſtolicall, were euer dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and indeede were heretikes.

Was Cyprian either an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike, or of that minde that whatſoeuer the Pope did condemne, was hereſie? why did he not then yeild to Stephanus who was Pope? For I thinke you meane by the See Apoſtolike, the Pope; otherwiſe you condemne Eugenius, who ſaide, as Aeneas Sylvius reporteth, that <hi>tantum aebeſt vt generalibus Concilijs debeat obedire, vt ſe dicat tunc maximè mereri cum concilij decreta contemnit;</hi> It is ſo farre from him that he ſhould obey generall Councells, that he doth then beſt deſerue, when he doth contemne the decrees of the ſame.

This proud bragge I haue diſprooued before by many teſtimonies, and now by Gods helpe, I will make it manifeſt to boyes. Theophilus Alexandrinus is plaine againſt traditions: in his 2. paſchal ſermon he writeth thus; <hi>Daemoniaci eſt ſpiritus instinctus aeliquid extra ſcripturarum authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem putare divinum:</hi> it is the inſtinct of a deuilliſh ſpirit to thinke any thing diuine without authoritie of ſcriptures: what ſpirits then haue Papiſts but deuilliſh ſpirits, who fight for their traſh of traditions. <hi>Caeſarius</hi> is as plaine, for reading of the Scriptures in his 20. homilie he taketh away the excuſe commonly vſed for not reading the ſame. <hi>Nemo dicat non mihi vacat legere;</hi> Let no man ſay I am not at leiſure to read the Scriptures. <hi>Inanis &amp; invtilis eſt excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatio iſta;</hi> this excuſe is vaine and vnprofitable.

Againe in his 3. Catechiſme, he is as plaine: <hi>Quemadmodum panis Euchariſtiae post Spiritus ſancti invocationem non amplius eſt communis panis, ſed eſt corpus Chriſti: ſic &amp; ſanctum hoc vnguentum, non amplius eſt vnguentum nudum atque commune, poſtquam iam conſecratum eſt, ſed eſt chariſma Chriſti:</hi> As the bread of the Euchariſt after the inuocation of the holy Ghoſt, is no more common bread, but it is the bodie of Chriſt, ſo is this holy oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment no more bare oyntment, nor common oyntment after it is conſecrated, but it is the gratious gift of Chriſt. Here is no more Tranſubſtantiation in the one then in the other. Likewiſe in his firſt Catechiſme, he writeth after the ſame manner; <hi>Quemadmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum enim panis &amp; vinum euchariſtia antè ſacram inuocationem ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randae trinitatis, panis erat, &amp; vinum merum, ſic &amp; cibi ciuſmodi pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae Sathanae ſuapte natura puri ſunt ſed invocatione daemonum impuri efficiuntur:</hi> euen as the bread and the wine of the Euchariſt before the inuocation of the adored Trinitie was bare bread and wine: ſo ſuch meates Sathans pomps were pure of their owne nature, but by inuocation of the deuills they are become impure. Loe what is become of your Tranſubſtantiation! Auguſtine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth worſhippers of pictures, <hi>Novi multos eſſe ſepulchrorum &amp; picturarum adoratores;</hi> I know, ſaith he, there are many that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore ſepulchres and pictures. Bellarmine in his firſt anſwers to this place, commeth in with his <hi>fortaſſes,</hi> peraduenture: in his laſt anſwer he confeſſeth that he wrote this booke when he was firſt conuerted. Here then it is manifeſt that Auguſtine condemneth worſhippers of pictures. Lactantius in his 6. booke, 3. chap. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth but two waies, <hi>duae ſunt viae, vna, quae in coelem ferat, altera qua ad inferes deprimat;</hi> there are two waies, one which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

God forbid: whoſoeuer liſteth to read the 5. chap of the 6. booke of his Confeſſions, ſhall finde that he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the Scriptures for themſelues. In his 14. chap. of the booke cited by the Doctor, he writeth thus; <hi>Quid putas faciendum, niſi vt eos relinquamus, qui nos invitant certa cognoſcere, &amp; poſtea imperant vt incerta credamus, &amp; eos ſequamur qui nos invitant prius credere, quod nondum valemus intueri, vt ipſa ſide valentiore facti, quod credimus intelligere mereamur, non iam hominibus ſed ipſo Deo intrinſecus men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem noſtram firmante, atque illuminante?</hi> what haue we to doe but to forſake them, that inuite vs to know certaine things, and afterwards command vs to beleeue vncertaine things, and to follow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19042:25"/> inuite vs, firſt to beleeue that which yet we are not able to behold, that beeing made ſtronger through faith, we may attaine to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that we beleeue now, not men, but God himſelfe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming and lightning our minde inwardly. The ſpirit of God therefore muſt cauſe vs to beleeue, otherwiſe we ſhall wauer and ſtagger. To conclude this point, many borne in hereſie and ſchiſme haue bin mooued by heretikes to beleeue the Scriptures, is hereſie therfore equal to the ſcriptures? nothing leſſe. The three Creedes we receiue, becauſe the doctrine is contained in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: but you doe not receiue Athanaſius his Creede, for he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth but two places, <hi>vitam aeternam, &amp; ignem aeternum. Omnes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines reſurgent cum corporibus ſuis, &amp; reddituri ſunt de factis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prijs rationem, &amp; qui benè egerunt ibunt in vitam aeternam, qui verò malè in ignem aeternum.</hi> All men ſhall riſe with their owne bodies, and ſhall giue an account of their deedes, and they which haue done well, ſhall goe into life euerlaſting, &amp; they which haue done euill, into euerlaſting fire. You teach that Infants vnbaptized ſhall be in a brimme of hell, and not in the fire of hell. Thus if you had bin wiſe, M. Doctor, you would haue bin ſilent concerning theſe Creeds. If I ſhould ſhew your contrarieties to the Apoſtles creed, I ſhould be ouerlong. That the holy Ghoſt doth proceede from the Father and the Sonne,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. de Chriſt. cap. 22.</note> Bellarmine prooueth plentifully out of the Scriptures. What an ignorant Doctor is this, that cannot ſee this myſterie prooued in holy Scripture? Touching the tearmes, as perſon, Trinitie, conſubſtantiall, Sacraments, what if they be not in Scriptures? the heauenly doctrine ſignified by the words is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in ſcriptures. If theſe wordes were neceſſarie to ſaluation, then men were damned before they were inuented, which I thinke the Doctor will not grant: for many beleeued the things, although the names were not extant. Auguſtine calleth the bookes of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie, and other, Canonical, becauſe they were read to edification: for I hope you will not oppoſe his authoritie to ſo many Fathers, as I haue before produced. In the place by you cited; he will haue thoſe books which are receiued of all Churches, preferred before thoſe which ſome Churches receiue not: hence it is manifeſt, that he maketh not all of equall authoritie.<note place="margin">Lib. 2 con. gaud. cap. 23.</note> Elſwhere he will haue the bookes of Machabees read, ſo it be <hi>non inutiliter &amp; ſobriè,</hi> not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably and ſoberly. Why doth he giue this caution to theſe bookes, if they were of like authoritie? And in his booke <hi>de praed.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19042:25"/> Sanct. c. 14.</hi> he confeſſeth when he did produce a teſtimonie out of the booke of Wiſdome, that the brethren did reiect it, &amp; there he contendeth not much for it. If it had bin Canonicall, he ſhould not haue ſo remiſſely pleaded for it. Thus it appeareth why he calleth theſe books canonical. Where you ſay that no heretike can charge the Church with adding or diminiſhing one iot from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; we muſt admire Gods prouidence and his loue towards his church: he preſerueth the Scriptures though men would take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the world. But if you meane that the church of Rome hath not altered the holy Scriptures, you muſt know that the Papiſts hold the Hebrew and the Greeke text to be corrupt, and haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed a Latin tranſlation, differing farre from the Hebrew and Greeke: and is not this to alter the ſcriptures? If I ſhould ſhew the corruptions of that tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlation, I ſhould be very tedious. I will name one: in the 1. of the Hebr. it is ſaid, <hi>Christ hath purged our ſinnes by himſelfe:</hi> theſe words <hi>[by himſelfe]</hi> are cleane ſtricken out of their Rhemiſts tranſlation; what an intollerable corruption is this? But I will conclude the matter in a ſyllogiſme:</p>
            <list type="syllogism">
               <item>They which eſtabliſh a corrupt tranſlation, alter the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or at leaſt a iot of the ſame:</item>
               <item>But the Papiſt eſtabliſh a corrupt tranſlation: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>And indeede I cannot ſufficiently wonder at them who eſtabliſh their Latine tranſlation <hi>eo nomine,</hi> becauſe it is Hieroms, and yet will not allow, his tranſlations of the Pſalmes: what dealing with the Scriptures is this? he hath corrected that tranſlation of the Pſalmes which they vſe, and yet they haue defied it. You further demand, why we ſhould truſt the Church of Rome rather in this then in other things? I anſwer, firſt that (as I haue prooued) we truſt not the Church of Rome but the ſcriptures themſelues: ſecondly it is a ridiculous conſequent, We beleeue the church of Rome in this point, <hi>ergo</hi> we muſt doe ſo in all other. To make your follie manifeſt vnto you ſelfe, M. D. you beleeue the church of England in ſome points, will you doe ſo in all? I would it were ſo. That we haue had nothing to doe with the Bible for a thouſand yeares, and that we haue robbed the Church of many bookes, are dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable vntruths. But I pray you, Syr, were not the ſcriptures preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the Greeke church as well as in the Romiſh church? did not the Iewes keepe the ſcriptures? and yet (to vſe your phraſe) our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour wreſted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of their hands, not as iuſt, but as vniuſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſours
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19042:26"/> of them. The Phariſies might haue vſed the ſame ſpeech to our Sauiour Chriſt, that the Doctor doth to vs. He hath three other queſtions in this chapter. The firſt is, how we relying onely vpon ſcripture can ſhew certainly which bookes be ſcripture, and which not? This queſtion I haue at large anſwered in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and therefore I will not repeat my anſwer. Secondly he would know of the vnlearned Proteſtant, how he knoweth the tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be true? I anſwer, that it is not neceſſarie to know euery thing to be truly tranſlated. The ſpirit of God ſpeaking in the ſcriptures, certifieth the conſcience of the vnlearned, that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the Engliſh tongue are the ſcriptures. The third queſtion it, why we beleeue our owne iudgements rather the Luthers or Calvins? I anſwer, we beleeue their iudgements that bring beſt proofes out of Scriptures. But M. Doctor, becauſe you haue po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vs with ſo many queſtions, now I will poſe you with one like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Why doe you receiue your latin tranſlation, rather vpon this Popes authoritie, then vpon that Popes authoritie? Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">

            <p>The aſſumption is manifeſt, becauſe they relie vpon Popes that may erre. Marellinus ſacrificed to idols, Liberius was an Arrian. And more then this, ſome Iudas might creepe into the office, as your Rhemiſts confeſſe. Some Popes they will not appeale to Councells, as it it manifeſt by the Councell of Baſil. And M.

O Antichriſtian Prelates, the Lord rebuke you for theſe your blaſphemies againſt his holy Bible! What triall of truth you haue, I hope I haue made plaine to your owne conſcience, M. Doctor. In the ende of this chapter you call vs <hi>boat-ſwanes,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting no iudge, and ſay we haue no meanes to reſt vntill we end in Atheiſme. That this name of boat-ſwanes may returne vpon your head, I pray you conſider how M.

Firſt the Doctor beggeth that which is a queſtion, taking the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church to be the true Church. We denie it: prooue it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you plead cuſtome. Secondly the Church in times paſt did giue the Euchariſt vnto Infants; was this an infallible rule, M. Doctor, to giue the Sacrament of the bodie and blood of Chriſt vnto children? if you denie that the Church did ſo, you may be confounded with infinite teſtimonies of authors. Auguſtine in his firſt booke <hi>de peccato mort. cap. 20.</hi> is plaine, vpon which place Eraſmus hath made this marginall note,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 2. cont. Iulian.</note> 
               <hi>Nunc parvulis non datur Euchariſtia,</hi> now the Euchariſt is not giuen to little ones. Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pope of Rome, as the ſame father teſtifieth, <hi>Definiuit parvulos niſi manducaverint carnem filij hominis, vitam prorſus habere non poſſe;</hi> that Infants cannot haue eternall life except they eate the fleſh of the ſonne of man. I could produce your owne men, who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the Church did vſe to giue the Sacrament to Infants. By which I conclude, that the Church is not an infallible rule to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect vnto truth. The Apoſtle Paul doth not onely fight with cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, but vſeth many other arguments and that in indifferent matters, as your Rhemiſts write, therefore you abuſe the place to eſtabliſh a cuſtome, to confirme matters of moment, when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle entreateth of indifferencie. Secondly I would you could truly ſay that you are the Church, as Paul did: you are departed from the Apoſtolicall Church. But heare what Theophylact wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vpon tnat place; <hi>Ad verecundiam Auditores haec dicta compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt, ne quid praeter Apoſtolorum conſuetudinem factitent;</hi> theſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings driue the auditors to ſhame, that they ſhould not doe any thing beſides the Apoſtles cuſtome. Bring vs therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles practiſe, and you ſhall cauſe vs to yeild to it. But that which he cannot obtaine by Paul, he would prooue by Auguſtine, who auoucheth that it is ſtrange madneſſe to diſpute of that which the vniuerſall Church practiſeth. Secondly he prooueth that Infants are borne in ſinne, becauſe the Church doth baptize them. To the firſt teſtimony I anſwer, that Aug. ſpeaketh of ceremonies, as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man muſt faſt before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion or no: &amp; ſuch like. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly I anſwer, that Papiſts muſt prooue their ceremonies to be vſed of the whole Church, as alſo that they be the Church. The originall of their ceremonie is ſet down in their writers, as in <hi>Bucch.</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:19042:28"/> &amp; others. To the ſecond argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t I anſwer that we haue infallible teſtimonies out of ſcripture to proue that infant are borne in ſin, beſides the cuſtom of the church which baptizeth them. And now becauſe you haue obiected a place out of the 5. part of the 18. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, heare what he the ſame S. Auguſtine writeth in the firſt part. I would haue you (ſaith he) to know that the Lord hath made vs ſubiect to a light yoke, and that he hath ioyned together the ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the new people with Sacraments, in number the feweſt, in obſeruation the eaſieſt in ſignification moſt excellent, ſuch as is Baptiſme conſecrated in the name of the trinitie, and the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of his bodie and blood, and if any other be contained in the Canonicall Scriptures. If S. Auguſtine had knowne your ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Sacraments, he would neuer haue come in with <hi>Si quid aliud,</hi> if any other. Immediately after he will haue ſuch ceremonies in the Vniuerſall Church, as are inſtituted by the Apoſtles, or by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councels: are all yours ſuch? The ceremonies of particular Churches are variable, as Auguſtine himſelfe confeſſeth. In his hundreth and nineteenth epiſtle and 19. part, he would haue theſe particular burthens cut off, complaining that the eſtate of the Iews is more tollerable, beeing ſubiect to ceremonies of God, then of Chriſtians ſubiect to humane praeſumptions. If it was thus in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtines time, what is it now? To reduce your argument into a ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme, thus you diſpute:</p>

But we are charged with great malepertnes for altering the maſſe, placing in ſtead thereof chapters pſalmes ill tranſlated, and ballads called Geneua pſalmes, with railing ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. If we had placed their golden legende of lies, it may be we ſhould haue heard nothing, the Pſalmes are Dauids pſalmes, and if there be any imperfections in our tranſlations, there are moe in theirs, our ſermons are not railing, except that be railing which diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth

            <head>The <hi>13.</hi> reaſon: Doctrine.</head>
            <p>The Doctor in this chapter giueth the Papiſt no ſmall blowe,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19042:29"/> who teach that the ſincere preaching of the word of God is no note of the Church. Here he will needes haue that Church whoſe doctrine tendeth to mortification and holineſſe of life to be the true Church, and contrariwiſe that congregation which teacheth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to be a falſe Church. Hence I gather that true doctrine is a note to diſcerne the Church: for if that be the true Church which teacheth holy doctrine; then holy doctrine is onely in the church, for if it be not inſeperable from the ſame it cannot marke and chalke the Church. Now by holy doctrine, Chriſtian reader, I meane not that which may haue a ſhew of holineſſe in the opinion of men, but that which gods word alloweth. The Phariſie may faſt and make great ſhew of pietie. The Montaniſts had three lents in the yeare: the falſe Apoſtles did teach doctrine which had a ſhewe of wiſdome,<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 2.15.</note> in voluntarie worſhip and humblenes of mind, and in not ſparing the bodie: out of which we gather that pretended pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and holines muſt not be made a note to diſcerne a Church, but ſuch holines of doctrine as Gods word doth allow, for indeed that onely is holy, and all other doctrine is prophane, whatſoeuer ſhew it may haue with men. The Doctor to prooue his opinion ſaith, that the church is called holy, becauſe it profeſſeth and teacheth nothing but that which is holy. Who would thinke that a Doctor could be ignorant in his creed? The church is called holy becauſe it is waſhed in the blood of Chriſt, and ſanctified by his ſpirit. The Apoſtle ſheweth that the Church hath no wrinckle, Eph. 5.27. which is as much as if he had called it holy. That this is ſo, it is plain, becauſe the triumpha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t church is holy, &amp; yet teacheth no doctrine: &amp; this triumphant church is vnderſtood in the creed as wel as the militant; witnes the Papiſts themſelues who teach alſo that it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led holy becauſe it is conſecrate to God. But graunt him that the Church is therefore called holy, becauſe it teacheth holy doctrine; doeth the Church of Rome teach ſuch doctrine? let vs ſee whether it be ſo or noe: here he will not compare liues, and yet he ſaith that Catholikes liue like Saints. What Saints Catholikes are I haue ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed before; to omit this then, &amp; to come to his grounds. He proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth their holineſſe of doctrine, becauſe Prieſts may not marrie. This is ſo farre from beeing holy doctrine, that it is deuilliſh do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as I will make plaine to your conſcience M. Doctor.

            <p>But M.

            <p>Thus M. Doctour, it had bin good for you to haue concealed this prophane doctrine of your impure prieſthood. You ſay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the Romane religion teacheth reſtitution of goods wrongfully gotten; ſo doe we teach and ſay with Auguſtine, <hi>Non remittitur peccatum niſi reſtituatur ablatum;</hi> the ſinne is not forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen without reſtitution: and therefore you ſlaunder vs moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtably, ſaying that we leaue all at large to our followers. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, the cathohke Romane religion teacheth obſeruation of vowes and promiſes; ſo doe we, of lawfull vowes and promiſes, but otherwiſe we ſay, <hi>in turpi voto muta decretum, in malis promiſſis reſcinde fidem,</hi> in a filthie vow change thy purpoſe, in wicked pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes diſanull thy faith. So doth Aquinas teach in his 2. 2. 88. queſt. art. 10. in theſe words: <hi>Poteſt contigere,</hi> It may happen, that a vow be ſimply euill, or vnprofitable, or a hindrance of a greater good, and then it may be changed. But you like filthie heretikes hold, that it is a greater euill to marrie after a vow, then to commit for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.

For your credit ſake hereafter M. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, neuer come in with your doctrine of vowes: I hope men by conſidering it will abhorre Poperie. But we are not yet come to an ende of this their doctrine. The catholike Romane religion teacheth abſtinence and faſting, which mortifieth our bodies and enricheth our countrey: ſo doe we, and doe abſtaine not onely from fleſh but from fiſh when we faſt, and from wine with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delicates: and for the enriching of our countrey, there are lawes made to prohibit the eating of fleſh on certaine daies and at certaine times. But we differ from the Papiſts in theſe points: firſt they teach, that religious faſting conſiſteth in choice of meates, as abſtinence from fleſh, cheeſe, egges; but we teach, that it conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in abſtinence from all kind of meats. It is well knowne that Popiſh faſting is feaſting, and many had rather be fed with wine, and ſpices, and delicates, then with fleſh. Secondly we teach, that we muſt faſt to humble our ſelues, to tame the fleſh, and for other reſpects; but they teach that they faſt to merit and to deſerue at Gods hands: nowe Chriſtian Reader iudge which ſide holdeth moſt truely and ſoundly concerning faſting. Some Papiſts write that we muſt abſtaine from fleſh and eate fiſh, becauſe God cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not the waters: is not this to make fleſh an vncleane thing? and ſo by conſequent they reſemble the old heretickes which conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the creatures as vncleane. The auntient Chriſtians when they faſted, had but one meale a day, and that at night: our Papiſts haue two, a dinner and a ſupper:<note place="margin">Bell. de I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iu.</note> but M. Doctor whether is this to faſt or no? to gorge your ſelues with eating fiſh and drinking wine in bowles. Wine inflameth concupiſcence as well as fleſh. The auntient Church did not reſtraine faſting to certaine meates, as you may ſee in Tertullian his booke, <hi>adverſus Pſychichos,</hi> Take heed, therefore leaſt you take part with Montanus in reſtraining to certain meats &amp; times. Spiridion did ſell fleſh in lent to be eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Secondly the gueſt did refuſe fleſh becauſe he was a Chriſtian. Spiridion faith therfore he ought to eate. What can be more direct againſt Popiſh faſting? The Papiſts ſay men
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19042:31"/> are no Chriſtians if they eate fleſh in lent: <hi>Spiridion</hi> ſaith, becauſe they are Chriſtians, therefore they ought to eate fleſh. Alcibiades liuing ſparingly was admoniſhed by God that he ſhould vſe all creatures.<note place="margin">Euſeb. l. 5. c. 3.</note> 
               <note place="margin">Poſſid. in vita Auguſt. cap. 22.</note> Auguſtine had alwaies wine, becauſe euery creature is ſanctified by the word and praier. By the ſame reaſon fleſh is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified as well as wine. A Chriſtian may ſay with Auguſtine, <hi>Non ego immunditiam obſonij timeo, ſed immunditiam cupiditatis;</hi> I feare not the impuritie of the creature, but the impuritie of my appetite. Take heede alſo leaſt you take part with Euſtathius in this point, as you doe in marriage.<note place="margin">So lib. 2. cap. 31.</note> For he did eſchew the companie of a Prieſt that had a wife, and taught that men muſt abſtaine from meates. I will not ſpeake of your doctrine of meriting by faſting, onely this I ſay, that if Popiſh faſting be right faſting, many can be content to enioy no other feaſting. To haue moſt daintie cates, fiſh and wine, pleaſeth the mouthes of many men as well as fleſh, To leaue this and to come to other points.

The ſame Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Romane religion teacheth marriage to be indiſſoluble; ſo doe we, excepting the caſe of adulterie: and your doctrine cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth many to fall into that foule ſinne; for the offending perſon knowing that the innocent perſon may not marrie againe, careth not to commit that ſinne if libertie were graunted the occaſion is taken away.

            <p>Hitherto the Doctor hath had but badde ſucceſse for his holy doctrine, let vs ſee if his ſucceſſe be better hereafter. The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Romane religion, ſaith he, teacheth that all laws of magiſtrates which be not expreſly againſt the word of God, doe binde the ſubiects in conſcience: the greater therefore is your ſinne, becauſe you care not to murder Princes. But what if the Pope giueth a diſpenſation? then you may doe what you liſt. O holy and heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doctrine. Our doctrine concerning magiſtrates lawes is this, that the authoritie in generall is to be regarded for conſcience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is Gods ordinance. But euery lawe doeth not binde Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but thoſe which are diuine, beeing immutable. And this doctrine is taught by your man Gerſon, as witneſſeth Bellarmine. There are no men that haue giuen greater obedience to magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, then Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, as the world can teſtifie. The Papiſts bring the Magiſtrates into contempt. The Emperour muſt lead the Popes horſe. Coſter glorieth that Pipin king of Fraunce,<note place="margin">43. p.</note> doing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence to the Pope did lead the Popes horſe: if Emperours muſt lead the Popes horſe and kiſſe his toe, who bring Magiſtrates to contempt, the Pope or the proteſtants? Henrie the fourth bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed, faſting from morning to night, waited for the Popes ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence three daies. If this be not to contemne Magiſtrates, I knowe not what is. In the booke of ceremonies the Emperour is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wonderfull ſeruilitie but I leaue this contempt of Magiſtrates and come to veniall ſinnes, and concupiſcence. A man may won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that we ſhould be charged with vnholy doctrine becauſe we teach euery ſinne to deſerue damnation. The greater the ſinne is, the more men ſhould abſtaine from it: therefore on the contrarie, the leſſer it is, the leſſe regard is had of it. By our doctrine then me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> regard ſinne more then by the Papiſts doctrine; becauſe we teach no ſinne to be ſmall: iudge therefore indifferent reader, which is moſt holy doctrine. Hierom ſaith, <hi>Neſcio an leue aliquod peccatum.</hi>

But the Proteſtant taking that away ſetteth open a dore to all wickednes and looſenes of life, as alſo to ignorance.

Satisfaction depending vpon confeſſion, is in the next place to be handled. The Catholike Romane religion, ſaith the Doctor, teacheth ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to be done either in this life or in Purgatorie, and vpon conſideration of this they builded ſo many goodly Churches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitals, &amp;c. In few words the doctor hath condemed, all their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious workes, as beeing done for wrong endes. We acknowledge the ſatisfaction of Chriſt to be our onely ſatisfaction for ſinne: and ſay with S. Iohn, <hi>If any man ſinne, he hath an Aduocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ieſus Chriſt, and he is the propitiation for our ſinnes.</hi> Maxius ſaith, that <hi>Chriſti paſſio nobis ſufficit ad ſalutem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Serm. 3.</note> Chriſts paſſion is ſufficient to ſaluation. And Bellarm. in his 2. booke <hi>de iuſtificat.</hi> and 5. chap. writeth thus; <hi>Nihil frequentius omnis ſcriptura teſtatur, quam Chriſti paſſionem &amp; mortem, plenam atque perfectam ſatisfactionem fuiſſe pro peccatis;</hi> The whole Scripture doth witnes nothing more often then that the ſuffering and death of Chriſt are a full and perfect ſatisfaction for our ſinnes. If man might ſatisfie for ſinne, he might be called a redeemer and a Sauiour, which is horrible to heare of.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19042:33"/> Neither doth this our doctrine robbe the poore of their almes, children of their education, and the ſicke of their reliefe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth men vnwilling to doe any good at all. The Doctor except he be blind may ſee, that men build Colledges and hoſpitalls, and relieue the poore, though they doe it not to ſatisfie for their ſinnes: but his confeſſion is to be accepted that faith, their building and giuing of almes is to ſatisfie: by which he diſgraceth all their workes. From ſatisfaction he commeth to freewill, ſaying, that their doctrine cauſeth the people to endeauour to doe good, and flee from all euill, the Proteſtant taking it away diſcourageth men vtterly from doing good workes: for who will goe about a thing which is not in his power? What could Pelagius haue ſaid more? M. Doctor, is it in our power to doe good vnto ſaluation or no without grace? anſwer directly. Our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Without me ye can doe nothing.</hi> Auguſtine writeth,<note place="margin">lib. 1. Retract. c. 15.</note> that <hi>voluntas in tantum eſt libera, in quantum eſt liberata;</hi> our will is ſo farre free, as it is freed. To ſet downe our doctrine briefly. We ſay with the ſame father 3. Hyp. <hi>eſſe fatemur liberum arbitrium omnibus hominibus non per quod ſit idoneum, qua ad Deum pertinent ſine Deo, aut inchoare aut cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te peragere:</hi> we confeſſe that all men haue freewill, not that it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble either to beginne or to perfect thoſe things which belong vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, without God, but onely in the works of this life whether they be good or euill. To ſhut vp the matter: doth Cyprian with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw men from doing good, when he ſaith, <hi>Dei eſt omne quod poſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> all is of God that we doe? Now we muſt ſpeake of the Maſſe: the Catholike Romane religion teacheth the holy Maſſe to be a ſacrifice in which the true bodie and blood of Chriſt is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vp, which maketh the people ſo deuout and reuerent. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, firſt what if the Prieſt haue no intent to conſecrate, what then is become of your ſacrifice? ſecondly we knowledge no bodily ſacrifice for ſinne, but onely Chriſt on the croſſe.

Where there is no remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinne, there is no more offering for ſinne:<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> but by Chriſts paſſion there is perfect remiſſion of ſinnes: <hi>ergo.</hi> Againe, Chriſt died but once, <hi>ergo</hi> he offered himſelfe but once. <hi>Ireneus</hi> writeth thus; <hi>Oportet not oblationem Deo facere,</hi> we muſt offer to God,<note place="margin">Lib. 4. cap. 34.</note> and in all things yeild thankes to the maker, with a pure minde, vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned faith, ſteadfaſt hope, and feruent loue, offering the firſt fruits of his creatures.

I might anſwer this reaſon one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the like, namely that the Papiſts ſtandeth vpon meere ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues, as theſe, I denie Chriſt to be the onely king, Prieſt, and Prophet of his Church; I denie that onely God is to be called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I denie the Scriptures to containe ſufficient doctrine vnto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; I denie we are ſaued onely by Chriſt: thus I might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede and ſhew that your religion ſtandeth vpon deſtructiues. But I will giue you arguments for the opinions which we hold. And to beginne with Baptiſme, with which you likewiſe beginne: you hold it to be ſimply neceſſarie vnto ſaluation, we denie it, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that Gods grace is not tied to the Sacraments, but that he may diſpenſe it as it pleaſeth him.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19042:38"/> if he be of another minde, but I let it alone. Catharin the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt aſsigneth neither heauen nor hell to infants, but a third place; and ſo ſheweth himſelfe a flat Pelagian, as I might ſhew: but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the reader to <hi>Auguſt. ſerm. 14. de ver. Apoſt. lib. 1. de poena mor. cap. 28.</hi> To be briefe, it is admirable to conſider the varietie of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh opinions about this point. <hi>Bellar. lib. 6. de amiſſ. grat. cap. 1.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree amongſt your ſelues you that teach ſo ſeuerally concerning Infants, before you come to charge the Proteſtants doctrine with bare negatiues. Next to baptiſme, we muſt ſpeake of inherent Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, which we doe not denie to be in men: for this inherent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes is ſanctification: but we teach this inherent righteouſnes to be imperfect, and cleaue onely to the righteouſnes of Chriſt: whoſe righteouſnes is the very thing that cauſeth a man to ſtand righteous before God, and to be accepted to life euerlaſting. This doctrine I maruell you dare once barke againſt, being ſo holy and ſo comfortable as it is. I will giue you reaſons of it. In the 3. to the Rom. we are ſaide to be <hi>iuſtified freely by his grace, through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption which is in Ieſus Chriſt, whome God hath ſet forth to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation through faith in his blood.</hi> By <hi>grace</hi> here, Bellarmine will haue inherent grace vnderſtood, becauſe the fauour of God is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſet forth by the word <hi>freely,</hi> as though to fortifie and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie a matter one thing may not be vttered in diuers wordes? which I might plentifully prooue. Secondly, ſaith he, the word <hi>[by]</hi> cannot be applied to the fauour of God, but to the formall cauſe, or meritorious cauſe, or inſtrumentall cauſe: this is likewiſe falſe as I might ſhew by ſome examples: but let this be graunted, that <hi>by grace</hi> is not meant the fauour of God in this place, Paul ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth himſelfe, ſaying, <hi>through the redemption which is in Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> And to retort Bellarmine his reaſon: if by the fauour of God we muſt vnderſtand inherent righteouſnes, then the Apoſtle needed not to haue added, <hi>through faith:</hi> becauſe faith is a part of inherent righteouſnes. Hence I thus conclude: if we are iuſtified formally and meritoriouſly by the redemption which is in Ieſus Chriſt, then are we not iuſtified by inherent iuſtice: but we are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified formally and meritoriouſly by the redemption that is in Chriſt: <hi>ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſame chapter we are ſaid to be iuſtified without workes, ſome anſwer works ceremoniall are to be vnderſtood; this anſwer Bellarmine refuteth becauſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh ſimply without
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19042:38"/> the workes of the law. What works doth Bellarmine vnderſtand? workes that goe before faith? But by his owne reaſon we muſt vnderſtand all works, for the Apoſtle ſpeaketh ſimply not reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his ſpeach to Moſes his law or to workes going before faith. Againe, ſuch workes are excluded as we may boaſt in, but we may boaſt in the works which follow faith eſpecially, ſeeing they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede partly of our ſelues, and not onely of grace, as the Papiſts teach. Auguſtine is worthie to be heard, ſpeaking againſt Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, vpon the like place of ſcripture; <hi>Non ait ex praeteritis operibus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De praedeſt &amp; gra. cap. 7.</note> 
               <hi>ſed cum generaliter dixerit non ex operibus, ibi &amp; praeterita intelligi voluit &amp; futura;</hi> he ſaith not of workes which are paſt, but ſeeing he ſpeaketh generally of works, he will haue both workes that are paſt and to come vnderſtood. So ſay I to the Papiſt, the Apoſtle ſpeaketh generally, why ſhouldeſt thou then reſtraine his ſpeach to works that are paſt? I let paſſe the arguments taken out of the 4. chap. which are many, and come to the place in the 2. of the Cor. the 5. chap. where Paul writeth that Chriſt <hi>was made ſinne for vs, that we might be made the righteouſnes of God in him.</hi> As Chriſt was made a ſinner, ſo are we made righteous: but Chriſt was made a ſinner by imputation: <hi>ergo</hi> we are made righteous by imputation.

Thus I haue giuen you a few reaſons why we cleaue onely to the righteouſnes of our bleſſed Sauiour Chriſt. I deſire you, M.

Nowe M. Doctor plead you merits and deſerts, I for my part will cleaue onely to grace. From workes of preparation we are to deſcend to good workes and free will, but of theſe I haue ſpoken before, and therefore I will not repeat the matters handled, but come to the keeping of Gods commandements, which we denie can be done in that perfection as the lawe requireth, for there is no man that ſinneth not, and to ſay as the Papiſts ſay, is plaine Pelagianiſme, <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilia dicis</hi> (ſaith Hierom) thou ſaieſt Gods commandement are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,<note place="margin">Ad C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Auguſtines teſtimonies are pregnant in this point, wherefore to leaue it, as alſo humane lawes, and to ſpeake of the ſeauen Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Papiſts make not onely 7. Sacraments, but many moe. For as they make orders one of the ſeauen, ſo doe they make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Sacraments in orders: as namely the order of Biſhops one ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, the order of Prieſthood another, and the order of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſhip another, as Bellarmine ſheweth. Hence it is plaine that they make about ſeauen ſacraments, yea they make inferior or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders alſo a Sacrament, and ſo they haue exceedingly multiplied the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19042:39"/> number of ſacraments: but we make but two, and this number I prooued before out of Auguſtine; beſides the Sacraments did flowe out of Chriſts ſide, but onely blood and water did iſſue out of Chriſts ſide, <hi>ergo,</hi> there are but two. Water ſignifieth Baptiſme, and blood the Euchariſt: touching the proofe of this, that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments did flowe out of Chriſts fide, read Bellarmine, lib. 1. <hi>de Sacr. cap. 15.</hi> To proceede:<note place="margin">Auguſt. in 8. tract. in Iob.</note> in a Sacrament there muſt be a word of inſtitution and an outward element: <hi>Accedat verbum ad clementum &amp; fiat Sacramentum,</hi> Let the word come to the element and ſo it ſhall be a Sacrament. But onely Baptiſme and the ſupper of the Lord, hath an outward element, and the word of inſtitution: <hi>ergo.</hi> I will not adioyne the teſtimonies of Fathers, neither ſhewe that Durand denieth matrimonie to be a Sacrament after the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Doctor nameth Prieſthood of which I haue ſpoken, as alſo of the ſingle life of the Cleargie. But concerning Prieſthood I would know whether his Prieſts are after Aarons order, or after Melchizedechs. Aarons order is ceaſed, Melchizedechs order is peculiar to Chriſt, what Prieſthood then would you haue M. Doctor? And whereas you ſay that we denie pennance, contritio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the perpetuall virginitie of the Virgin Marie, with trimming vp of Churches, ceremonies, and ſinging, it is falſe; for we teach godly ſorrow to be neceſſarie vnto ſaluation, and do not denie the perpetual virginitie of the virgin Marie, neither do we condemne moderate trimming vp of churches &amp; ceremonies: as for ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the reall preſence, I haue handled them before: as alſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Images, and the viſibilitie of the Church. I will ſpeake of praier vnto Saints, which as yet I haue not ſpoken of.

And if the Doctor had read that ſame famous learned proteſtant Zanchy, he would neuer haue written as he hath, for Zanchie hath written of Gods attributes, of the Trinitie, and of the Creation, ſo as I feare few papiſts can doe the like. But as for the ſchoolemen, they haue defiled Diuinitie with idle queſtions. Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus hath ſet downe many of them: as whether God can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit euery good thing; whether he can make the world better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he did, whether he can make of a harlotte a virging: whether the Ideas of all things are in Gods minde or noe: whether the Pope may abrogate the Apoſtles decrees: whether he can eſtabliſh any thing that fighteth with the Goſpell: whether he can commaund Angels, or take away purgatorie. Theſe queſtions with many moe hath Eraſmus witneſſed to be diſputed amongſt papiſts, where
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19042:41"/> you ſay, M. Doctor, that if any Proteſtant ſhould appeare in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike ſchooles, he durſt not once open his mouth in matters of learning: you ſtill continue your rayling ſpirit, and, as I hope, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace your ſelfe, more then you are able to doe the Proteſtants learning. I will name you ſome that durſt ſhew their faces in any popiſh ſchoole, both for knowledge in tongues, and arts. <hi>Iunius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius</hi> for learning in diuinitie may be matched with any Papiſt: and for arts, what ſay you, M. Doctor, to <hi>Ramus?</hi> whoſe learning the world can witnes. But, ſay you, this groſſe ignorance of theſe new Goſpellers is the cauſe that people doe remaine vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly void of the knowledge of myſteries, which they are bound to beleeue vpon paine of damnation. If you meane popiſh myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, I anſwer, the people are not bound to know them. And what ignorance you keepe the people in, your practiſe ſheweth: who take from them the Scriptures, which are the key of knowledge. They muſt not read the Scriptures, becauſe holy things muſt not be giuen to dogges, they muſt haue their ſeruice in latin, and be taught by Images which you call Lay mens books. Yea your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of vnfolden faith, that a ſimple man muſt beleeue as the Church beleeueth, may teſtifie what knowledge the Papiſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in the people. I will not ſpeake of your dumme miniſters which cannot barke: it is well knowne that your prieſts haue bin idols, and therefore the people in poperie could be little better. And indeede to me it is no ſmall confirmation of the truth, that the Proteſtants require ſuch knowledge in the people, whereas Papiſts rather hold them in ignorance. Not to be tedious, Hierom of Prage his learning is commended by Papiſts themſelues, and ſchoole diuinitie is condemned by Langius a Papiſt. The Doctor further to amplifie our vnlearnednes ſpeaketh thus: Take the moſt learned Doctor of them all, and ſet him to reaſon with an heathen or with an Atheiſt, and you ſhall ſee what goodly arguments he will make. Are you not once abaſhed thus to proceed in vntruths? Philip Morney lord of Pleſſis hath written ſo learnedly againſt Atheiſts, that I thinke fewe Papiſts can doe the like. Yet I would not haue you to thinke that it is neceſſarie to prooue the faith of the bleſſed Trinitie, and other points of diuinitie with naturall reaſons. Read Aquinas in his firſt part and 32. queſt. where you ſhall finde that, <hi>Sufficit defendere non eſſe impoſſibile quod praedicat fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des;</hi> it ſufficeth to defend that that is not impoſſible which faith
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19042:42"/> teacheth. I admire with you the prouidence and goodnes of God towards his Church, in furniſhing it with all kinds of learning and ſciences, whereby it may maintaine it ſelfe againſt all ſorts of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, be they Iewes, Turkes, or heretikes whatſoeuer: and I alſo doe not denie your diſputations and reſolutions of caſes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; but I denie that the Proteſtant doth not meddle with theſe things, but fraughteth his ſhippe onely with faith, and neuer beateth his braine about ſinnes. Theſe odious vntruths the world can controll: and for your ſchoole diuinitie, might not the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philoſophers haue made the ſame argument againſt Chriſts Apoſtles, they might haue cried, loe a few rude ignorant men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the world? ſo the Papiſts not vnlike the heathen, crie a fewe ignorant Lutherans ſeduce the people. The Apoſtles wanted your ſchoole tearmes, M. Doctor, yet it was the truth which they taught. But now I draw your reaſon into a ſyllogiſme:</p>

The bloodie actes of Papiſts are notorious to the world. The reſt of the Doctors railing in this chapter is not worthy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aunſwer.

If the Vicar of Waram had his trull from coleman hedge, let him anſwer ſuch a filthie fact himſelfe, charge not our religion with his actions. I lament, M.

            <p>That the doctrine of the Romane Church hath euer remained without change, it is as falſe as it is true that in the Apoſtles time the Romans faith was reported through the world.

Gregorie ſaith, it was heard that the ſubdeacons of Sicilie ſhould not be married, he gaue them leaue to marrie, although his predeceſſors had forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den it. Yet is this thing againe changed, for nowe ſubdeacons haue no wiues. Pope Vrban the 4. inſtituted the feaſt of the Lords bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and the ſolemne Preceſſion. What ſhould I ſpeake of Images and the peoples conſent in election of miniſters, that the people did giue voices, it is plaine by Bellarmines confeſſion, <hi>lib. de Cleric. cap. 17.</hi> and that in Gregories time. By theſe fewe examples euery man may ſee a change, I will not produce any moe, becauſe the Doctor named but one point. And why ſhould we not thinke of a change in points of religion, ſeeing one Pope would change the acts of another?

Thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing defended the calling of proteſtants, let vs ſee what notes of hereticks and falſe prophets the ſcriptures giue. Paul in the firſt of Tim. and 4. chap. giueth theſe notes of falſe Prophets, to forbidde marriages, and to command abſtinence from meates. Where are theſe to be found at this day? in papiſts or proteſtants? in proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts no man will affirme. The Manichees did not ſimply forbid mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, neither condemned they ſimply meats. For <hi>Auditores qui appellantur apud Manichaeos, &amp; carnibus veſcuntur, &amp; ſi voluerint vxores habent.</hi> Their hearers did eate fleſh, and if they would had wiues. It remaineth then that theſe notes be found in Papiſts. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other note of falſe prophets is to draw men to the ſeruice of idols, Deut. 13.2. Doth this agree any way to Proteſtants, who abando<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all monuments of Idolatrie? to the Papiſts it agreeth, becauſe they teach that the very wood of the Croſſe is to be worſhipped with diuine honour. Polidor Virgil. <hi>lib. 6. cap. 13.</hi> ſpeaking of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Saints images, ſaith, <hi>Haec pars pietatis parum differt ab impieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> this pietie differeth little from impietie. The third note of falſe teachers is to deſpiſe Dominion as Iude ſpeaketh, verſ. 8. doth not the Pope ſo, who will not be ſubiect to the Emperour, no not to a generall Councell? as Witneſſeth Eugenius who would not yeeld to the Councel of Baſil. Yea the papiſts ſuborne traytours to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their lawfull Prince, as their own writings prooue. The booke I haue named before.</p>
            <p>The fourth note of falſe Apoſtles is to teach iuſtification by the works of the lawe, as it is manifeſt by the Epiſtle of Paul to the Galat. Doe we ſo, or the papiſts? neither can the papiſts anſwer that Paul excludeth the workes of nature onely, and not of grace. For Paul excludeth not onely the workes of nature, but the workes of the ceremoniall and morall lawe, as it is plaine. For who can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the Galathians beeing inſtructed in Chriſt, would whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exclude him from iuſtification, and ſeeke for iuſtification either by the works of nature, or by the ceremoniall law without Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, the falſe Prophets ſpeake viſions of their own hearts. Ierem. 23.16. ſo doe the papiſts deceiue people with lying viſions &amp; doctrines of men, as I haue proued. They teach that the Pope cannot erre, that he is aboue Councels; where hath the Lord euer taught theſe things in his word?

The Doctor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his 20. chapter confeſſeth that pariſh churches are dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto Saints. When you haue anſwered theſe ſyllogiſmes M. Doctor, you ſhall haue more proofes of your Idolatrie. Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ingeniouſly confeſſeth, that pictures of God are not deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the people without daunger, except they be inſtructed of their prelates, but the world knoweth that in diuers places of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, like Prieſt like People to haue bin, and Prieſts haue bin very Idols themſelues.</p>
            <p>The third lie is, that ſome proteſtants ſay that the Catholikes hould that Chriſt ſatisfied onely for originall ſinnes, and that hee ordained the Maſſe for other ſinnes which to be a manifeſt lie all the bookes written of this matter by Catholike diuines, doe plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtifie. M. Doctor, for triall of this lie theſe are Canus his words concerning Catharine. <hi>Amborſij Chatharini deliratio patet, peccata ante Baptiſmum adoniſſa per crucis ſacrificium remitti,</hi>
               <note place="margin">433.</note> 
               <hi>poſt baptiſmum vero, per ſacrificium altaris.</hi> The dotage of Ambroſe Catharine is manifeſt, that ſinnes before baptiſme are remitted by the ſacrifice of the croſſe; but ſinnes after baptiſme, by the ſacrifice of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Marke M. Doctor that your own man Canus chargeth Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine with dotage, in that he held, that ſinnes onely committed before baptiſme were remitted by the ſacrifice of the croſſe, thus the lie is turned vpon your ſelfe. Remember alſo that your ſchoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men teach that Chriſt came principally to take away originall ſin, and ſo doth Bellarmine alſo lib. 4. <hi>de Rom. pont. cap. 10. in fine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth lie is, the proteſtants aſſime that the Catholikes doe teach that by choyce of meats; and other humane conſtitutions, remiſſion of ſinnes is obtained, I doubt not but they which haue
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19042:49"/> thus written could prooue their ſaying; but M. Doctor doe you not make faſting to conſiſt in choice of meates? this you can not denie,<note place="margin">Aquin 2.2.4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This ſome can teſtifie at this day.</p>
            <p>The fifte lye toucheth the Sinalchadicall articles which I haue not ſeene, therefore I cannot ſay any thing to it, but I thinke that they could prooue there aſſertion; if they could not, let them anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer for themſelues, yet thus much M. Doctor I ſay, that if the Sacrament giue grace <hi>ex opere operat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If Baptiſme doe ſoe, then doth pennance &amp; ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent giueth grace without faith.</p>
            <p>The ſixte lye toucheth not any one Proteſtant, but all wee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme forſooth that Papiſts doe worſhip Saints in ſtead of Chriſt, and doe honour them as Gods, which is a groſſe impudent lye as euery man knoweth, is this a lye M. Doctor? doe you not pray to the virgin Mary thus? <hi>Maria mater gratiae, mater miſericordiae, tu nos ab hoſte protege, &amp; hora mortis ſuſcipe.</hi> O Marie the mother of grace, the mother of Mercy defend vs from our enemies, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs at the houre of death. What is this but to make her God? doe you not build Churches i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Saints? which is to make them Gods as I haue prooued, yea you pray to this Saint againſt the plague, to that Saint againſt the tooth ache, and ſo in other diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is not this meere heatheniſme? did not the heathen ſo? wee ſhould pray to God againſt all diſeaſes. Furthermore you pray thus vnto Thomas, by the blood of Thomas which for thee hee
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19042:49"/> did ſpend, make vs O Chriſt to clime whither Thomas did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend. Many ſuch blaſphemous praiers might I recite: and I anſwer that ſimple people haue made ſuch Gods. I cannot let paſſe an intollerable prayer of ſome papiſts to the Virgin Marie. <hi>Roga pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem, iube natum.</hi> Intreat the father, command the ſonne.

            <p>The ſeauenth lie concerneth M. Haddon, for anſwer of which I referre thee Chriſtian Reader to M. Foxe a man of famous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, who hath anſwered Oſorius. That the Abbot of S. Albons couenanted for a concubine, <hi>ad purgandum renes,</hi> to purge the reines, a thing ſo notorious, that common lawyers can ſhewe it in record.<note place="margin">Vide Iuellum, 559.

                     <desc>•</desc>

What ſhould I alleadge the common ſaying, as M. Harding calleth it. <hi>Si non caſtè, cautè.</hi> If not chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet warily. Stewes in Rome are notorious to all the world: and one calleth them a neceſſarie euill. If the Pope for money ſuffereth Stewes, why ſhould we not thinke that he will ſuffer Prieſts to haue Concubines for money, eſpecially ſeeing that you hold that the Pope may diſpenſe againſt the Apoſtle; yet he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth as you ſay Prieſts marriage. By theſe things euery man may ſee, what a lie it is to ſay that the Pope for money giueth Prieſts leaue to haue concubines, and thus haue I ended your lies, which as you ſay, the Proteſtants charge the Catholikes with. Marke Chriſtian reader, firſt that ſome of them are but particular mens ſayings, and therefore the whole church is not to be charged with them. Secondly, marke the number in ſo many writings of Proteſtants. Thirdly, marke the anſwer vnto them, and thou ſhalt finde many of them, if not all, no lies but trueths.</p>
            <p>Before I ſet downe lies of Papiſts, I will anſwer the lies which ſome Proteſtants lay vpon the Fathers. Melancthon ſaid of Auguſtine, that he taught originall ſinne to be taken away in Baptiſme, not that it was not any more, but that it was not imputed. Whereas Saint Auguſtine ſpoke not there of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne but of Concupiſcence. M. Doctor are you ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that you know not original ſin to be concupiſcence? Aquinas
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19042:50"/> in his 1. 2. quaeſt. 82. art. 3. defendeth this point, that originall ſinne is concupiſcence. If originall ſinne be concupiſcence, I hope by right conuerſion in Logycke, concupiſcence is originall ſinne. If a man be a reaſonable creature, then a reaſonable creature is a man. And if concupiſcence be taken away, then is originall ſinne taken away, ſo as it is not imputed. Now M. Doctor vpon your owne doctrine, marke howe I conclude. If concupiſcence be remitted in Baptiſme, ſo as it is not imputed, then it was ſinne before it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; but it remaineth the ſame in the regenerate according to the ſubſtance of the thing. <hi>ergo:</hi> it is ſinne in the regenerate. This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is plaine by Aquinas, who in 1. 2. quaeſt. 99. art. 5. teacheth that the firſt motions of ſenſualitie are not deadly ſinnes in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, becauſe the perſon doeth aggrauate the ſinne: if the perſon doeth make the ſinne greater, then is concupiſcence ſinne in the godly, becauſe it was ſo in the vngodly. Neither can you anſwer that that ſaying is vnderſtood of voluntarie ſinnes, for the firſt motions are not ſo by your owne doctrine.</p>
            <p>The ſecond lie is, ſome Proteſtants ſay S. Bernard recanted Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachiſme at his latter ende, and why ſhould not ſome thinke ſo, ſeeing he writeth thus? <hi>Fateor non ſum dignus, nec proprijs poſſum me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritis, regnum obtinere caelorum, caeterùm Dominus meus duplici iure il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lud poſſidens, haereditate patris, &amp; merito paſſionis, altero ipſe contentus, alterum mihi donat.</hi> I confeſſe I am not worthy, neither can I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the kingdome of heauen by mine owne merits, by my Lord poſſeſſing it by a double right, by his fathers inheritance, and the merit of his paſſion, beeing content with one of them himſelfe, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the other to me. I wiſh all Papiſts and Monkes for their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation ſake, were of Bernards minde, and I thinke this is to recant Monachiſme, for Monkes looke for ſaluation by their merits and workes.<note place="margin">Lib. 2. de grat. c. 15.</note> I will ſet downe that excellent place of Luke, with Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines gloſſe vpon it. <hi>Feare not little flocke, it is your fathers pleaſure to giue you a kingdome. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erbum complacuit, &amp; nomen pater, &amp; vocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bula illa, puſillus grex, indicant gratiam, non Juſtitiam.</hi> The word it pleaſeth, the nowne father, and theſe words little floke, ſhewe grace, not iuſtice. Thus the kingdome of heauen is an inheritance giuen vs of our Father, not deſerued by vs.</p>
            <p>The laſt lie is, ſome Proteſtants affirme the Fathers to haue thought otherwiſe then they wrote: this is true of Papiſts. For the Rhemiſts beeing preſſed with Chryſoſtomes authoritie, for the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:19042:50"/> reading of Scriptures by Laymen, ſay, that he ſpake as e pulpit ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and not as a teacher: belike pulpit men ſpeake not that which they thinke. Let the Reader then iudge whether you ſay the Fathers ſpake as they thought or no. For further triall of this, I referre the Reader to that which I haue alleadged out of Bellarmine concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Fathers in the Reaſon of Fathers. Hierom in his apologie to Paumichius ſaith, that ſome things are ſpoken <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, alia <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for exerciſe ſake, and other things for opinions ſake: <hi>ergo,</hi> the fathers ſpake not all things dogmatically, but ſome things rhetorically. Nazianzen alſo biddeth his chaire farewell. The reſt of the chapter concerneth Luther, whoſe ſpeeches haue beene ſomewhat vehement; but not knowing the reaſon which he might haue to vſe ſuch, I can neither abſolue him, nor condemne him for them. I will now ſet downe popiſh lies. I begin with the Doctors, in the firſt chapter he ſaith, that in England it is manifeſt that all were Papiſts without exception, from the firſt chriſtening there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, vntil this age of King Henrie the eight. This as I haue proued, is a famous lie; witneſſe Wickliffe who liued in England, and yet was he no papiſt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond lie is, that hereticks haue euer taken their names of ſome one who began that hereſie: this is a lie, for ſome heretickes, as the Cathariſts, are called of their ſect, and not of the author.</p>
            <p>The third lie is in the third chapter, the Catholikes haue euer kept vnitie and concord in ſuch a peaceable manner, as neuer any one in England, or Ireland diſſented or diſagreed in any point of doctrine, from him which liued in the vtmoſt parts of the Eaſt. This is ſuch a lie as needeth no manifeſtation of it. Yet I will name one point more then I haue before.<note place="margin">Hart.</note> Some papiſts in England held that the Pope may depoſe Princes: others denie it.</p>
            <p>The fourth lie is in the ſame chapter, where he ſaith that all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of lawfull Councels, and Popes doe agree in all points of doctrine, one with another. This I haue prooued a lie.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, in the 5. chapter he ſaith that all countreies which euer beleeued in Chriſt, were firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted to his faith by ſuch as were either preciſely ſent, or at the leaſt wiſe had their authoritie from the Pope, who liued in the time in which they were conuerted. This I haue prooued a lie.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, in the ſame chapter he ſaith, that Ieſuites are executed in England onely in regard of their ſacred function, which to be a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:19042:51"/> lie, their owne bookes can teſtifie, beſides the confeſſion of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</p>
            <p>Seauenthly, in the fift reaſon he belieth M. Caluin, calling him a Sere backt prieſt for Sodomie. For I will omit the lie of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution onely in England in the ſame chapter.</p>
            <p>Eightly, in the tenth chapter, he ſaith that Catholike Romane religion is taught by all the auntient Fathers, of the firſt, ſecond, third, fourth, fift, and ſixe hundred yeares.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, in the 13. chap. he ſaith, that we meddle litle with reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of goods, but leaue all at large to our followers, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of any ſuch crime.</p>
            <p n="10">10. In the ſame chapter, he ſaith, the Proteſtant teacheth the landlord to doe what he liſteth with his own.</p>
            <p n="11">11 In the ſame place he ſaith, that we teach not reward of good and bad life in the world to come: which all men can teſtifie to be a lie; although we diſclaime the merit of good works, yet we teach the merit of ſinne.</p>
            <p n="12">12 In the 14. Reaſon he ſaith, that we denie the perpetuall vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie of Marie, which is an vntruth.</p>
            <p>In the 15. Reaſon he hath many lies, firſt that we haue nothing but a number of pelting obiections taken out of Caluins Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or out of the Magdeburſens, or ſome hereticall pamphlet. Secondly he ſaith, that we trouble our ſelues with nothing, but with the controuerſies of this time. Thirdly, that Proteſtants doe ſcarce vnderſtand the tearmes of learned ſciences, which others doe fully poſſeſſe. Fourthly he ſaith, that the Clergie in Queene Maries time, was more learned then now it is.</p>
            <p>Fiftly he ſaith, that the moſt learned Doctor of them all is vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant of ſchoole diuinitie.</p>
            <p>Sixtly he ſaith, that the Proteſtant neuer medleth with caſes of conſcience, but fraighteth his ſhip onely with faith, and neuer bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his braine about ſinnes.</p>
            <p>In the ſixteenth Reaſon he ſaith, that all the miniſters nowe are naught, yea he asketh in the ſame chap. what woman is nowe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried without touch of her honeſtie?</p>
            <p>I will gather no moe lies, out of this Doctor, I will ſet downe ſome out of other Papiſts. The Rhemiſts vpon the ſixt of Luke write, that Proteſtants are wont to ſay, <hi>All is very eaſie,</hi> which is a lie.</p>
            <pb n="87" facs="tcp:19042:51"/>
            <p>Againe ſay they, the Proteſtants thinke that to burne, is to be tempted onely, which is a lie. 1. Cor. 7.</p>
            <p>Thirdly vpon the 9. chap. of the firſt epiſt. of Paul to the Cor. they ſay, that proteſtants will not haue men worke well in reſpect of reward at Gods hands: which is a lie.</p>
            <p>I deſire thee Chriſtian reader to read the Rhemiſts annotatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, where thou ſhalt finde many ſlaunders, but I delight not in theſe things.</p>
            <p>Bellarmine affirmeth that Caluin maketh God the author of fin: againe he ſaith, that Caluin holdeth that the ſaints departed are not bleſſed: he ſaith alſo, that he died calling vpon the deuill, which are monſtrous lies.</p>
            <p>Genebrard accuſeth Caluin of errour, in ſaying that the ſonne of God is God of himſelfe. Bellarmine defendeth Caluine againſt Genebrard: nowe let euery man iudge of this ſyllogiſme.</p>

            <p>Chriſtian reader, I would not haue vſed this tearme of lying ſo often, but that I haue beene vrged by the Doctor. For railing I referre thee to M.

            <head>The <hi>20.</hi> reaſon: Keeping in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Gods benefits.</head>
            <p>That the memorie of Gods benefits is carefully to be regarded, we denie not M. Doctor. The heathen haue condemned ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude for a heynous ſinne. <hi>Beneficii memoriam qui recipit, habere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet;</hi> he that receiueth a benefit, ought to remember it. The Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans made a lawe, that the vnthankefull perſon might be ſued as well as a debter: this is ſo cleere as that no man can denie it: and I would it were as eaſie to perſwade vnto thankefulneſſe, as it is to ſpeake of it. But I feare me it happeneth to the papiſt as it doth to the vſurer, who ſpeaketh againſt vſurie, that he may practiſe it without ſuſpition: for the papiſt inueyeth againſt ingratitude and vnthankefulneſſe, leaſt he ſhould be argued of it. For this is to forget God, to breake his lawes. The Iewes in the 32. of Deut.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:19042:52"/> are charged to haue forgotten God, and Dauid in the 106. pſalme ſaith they made a calfe in Horeb, &amp; worſhipped the golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> image, they forgat God their Sauiour which had done great things in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt. Yet did the Iewes make an image vnto God, Exod. 32. and worſhipped God in the Image, for Aaron proclaimed an holy day vnto the Lord, and can any man imagine that Aaron ſhould think an idol to be that God, which brought the people out of Egypt? He that was to be high Prieſt, would he thinke the worke of his hands to be God? Thus you with the Iewes in the very things which you ſay put you in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of God, forget God. Nowe I reduce your argument into a ſyllogiſme.</p>

            <p>I denie the propoſition, and ſay, that this outward pompe is fit for the Whore of Babylon. We can remember god without theſe externall rites. The preaching of the Goſpel crucifieth Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eies, the Sacraments ordained of God himſelfe doe liuely ſet forth Chriſt, and the bleſſings of God within and without vs, and of euery ſide of vs are ſo many, that men can hardly forget him vnleſſe they forget the earth that beareth them, the heauens that couer them, the day that guideth them, and the night that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them reſt. But that M. Doctor you may ſee howe well in this obiection you agree with the heathen, remember that Celſus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting to the Church the want of feaſts, is anſwered by Origen, <hi>Feſtum eſt facere officium,</hi> a feaſt is to doe a dutie. Origen numbreth the feaſts of Chriſtians to be the Lords day, Eaſter and Pentecoſt. Hereby men may ſee what cauſe we haue to renounce poperie, which taketh part with the heathens in their obiections. Socrates in his 5. booke and 22. chapter, diſchargeth feſtiuall daies of the Apoſtles inſtitution. <hi>Apoſtolis propoſitum fuit, non vt leges de feſtis di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebus ſancirent, ſed vt rectè viuendi rationis &amp; pietatis nobis authores eſſent.</hi> The Apoſtles purpoſe was not to make lawes of feaſts but to be authors of pietie and of godly life.

The ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of your feaſts may be read in Faſcicul. Temp. and others. But I haue ſpoken of theſe feaſts in another booke, and therefore I will not make any longer diſcourſe of them. By theſe teſtimonies euery one may ſee what moment the obiection of feaſts hath.

Now Chriſtian reader marke the Doctors follies in this chapter. The firſt is this, God commanded the Iewes many feaſtes, all which were obſerued to himſelfe, <hi>ergo.</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may haue feaſtes dedicate vnto Saints. What a pitifull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is this? as though the Church might doe whatſoeuer God doth. Yea what a conſequent is this, God ordained feaſtes vnto himſelfe, therefore the Romane Church may ordeyne feaſts vnto Saints. Theſe arguments hange together like ropes of ſande. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſeth that parriſh churches were dedicated to ſaints, which is flat Idolatrie, for onely God muſt haue a temple and a church as I haue prooued. Thirdly he ſaith that by meanes of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, pictures, &amp; croſſes, the moſt vnlearned amongſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple knowe more of the miſteries of chriſtian religion, then ſome of our miniſters know. If this be ſo it is a horrible ſhame for mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, for this I know, that ſome vnlerned people haue worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Images, as gods, but indeed what is this, but to contemne gods wiſome and ordinance, who hath not ordained Images to teach the people, but his word to inſtruct them. Take heed M. Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of this horrible ſinne, to make your ſelues wiſer then God. Fourthly the Doctor ſaith that we haue noe more warrant for ſolemnizing of the ſonday, then we haue for S. Lawrence his day, for other reaſon or warrant we haue none but the authoritie of the Roman church, fye, fye M. Doctor that you ſhould thus bewray your ignorance.

            <head>The <hi>21.</hi> reaſon: The Proteſtants begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and proceeding againſt their conſciences.</head>
            <p>This chapter hath many wordes to little purpoſe, firſt Luther
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19042:54"/> is charged to ſay that he could ſee into another mans heart or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: who will beleeue Luther ſhould ſpeake thus, except he meant he could doe it by plaine words and manifeſt deeds: &amp; this M. Doctor you confeſſe your ſelfe may be done. I hope, if Luther ſaie that he could ſee into another mans conſcience, he had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meaning but by plaine words and manifeſt deeds. Luther was not ſo ſottiſh as you would beare men in hand, to make himſelfe a God. But M. Doctor, if your reaſon be good, to prooue that ſome Proteſtants ſpeake and write againſt their conſciences, becauſe they ſuſpect others to doe ſo (for commonly a man thinketh o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be as himſelfe is) then you ſpeake and write againſt your conſcience, becauſe you are ſuſpitious, yea vpon ridiculous reaſons and vntruths, you charge men to write againſt their conſciences. This is your own reaſon and argument, and therefore cannot be denied. For proofe that you charge men to write againſt their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, onely vpon ridiculous reaſons, let the reader iudge, I will ſet down your arguments. Luther confeſſed that he began againſt his conſcience; <hi>ergo,</hi> he proceeded ſo. M. Doctor to admit your antecedent, who wil graunt your conſequent? for, here you ſay that he proceeded ſo farre, as he thought that by deſperate neceſſitie he muſt go on, and ſo compare him to Iulius Caeſar. The truth is, he ended his life moſt heauenly, as M. Doctor Whitakers ſheweth out of Melancthon and Sleidon. We will not credit your ſlaunderous writings of him, but the writings of the forenamed men. From Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Doctor commeth to Zwinglius, who is ſaid to haue deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſecretly the reall preſence, for many yeres before he brake off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Roman Church, but yet inwardly he diſſembled his mind. What then if Zwinglius did thus, did he therefore proceed againſt his conſcience, becauſe he remained ſometime in the Romane church, after he had ſeene the trueth of the Sacrament? What ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man would ſhape ſuch concluſions? If this be to proceede a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt conſcience, Papiſts in England proceede againſt their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, for they continue in our Church, though they ſecretly diſſemble their opinions: many examples hereof might be giuen. Touching Nemo the Anabaptiſte, what haue we to doe with him? The Proteſtants haue moſt ſoundly confuted the ſect of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts, when Papiſts haue taken their eaſe. And Chriſtian Reader, I deſire thee to behould howe the Doctor dealeth, (whether againſt his owne conſcience or no, I leaue to God)
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:19042:55"/> in charging vs with Anabaptiſts ſpeeches, whereas we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſuch lewd ſectaries, as he himſelfe can teſtifie. Thomas Bell is (as I thinke) aliue, and therefore can anſwer for himſelfe. Wherefore I leaue him, who hath learnedly written againſt Poperie: and come to Melancthon, who is charged to proceede againſt his conſcience, becauſe he was ſad and gaue himſelfe to weeping. O M. Doctor. howe doe you forget your ſelfe? is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one a ſinner againſt his conſcience that weepeth and ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and that cannot by and by be comforted? Dauid was many times heauie, and his ſoule had not alwaies comfort, yet was Dauid a man after Gods owne heart. Concerning Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtadius, I will not ſay any thing, neither doe I regard what any Lutherane hath written of Zuinglius and Oecolampadius. As for Bucer, it is a lewde ſlaunder that he had no religion at all God wil be reuenged of you M. Doctor, for blaſpheming his ſeruants af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner. Biſhop Iuell is charged to ſhewe himſelfe without God and conſcience: he doth rent in peeces the text of Doctors, and inuerteth the ſenſe of the ſame. If this reuerend Biſhoppe had done thus, his enemies would haue found it, &amp; no doubt M. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor you would haue noted ſome places, but ſeeing you haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no ſuch corruptions, we account it a deteſtable lie. No no, your owne men change the words of Fathers. I will referre you to pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Bellarm. <hi>lib. 1. de grat. &amp; lib. arbit. cap. 11.</hi> doeth ſhamefully corrupt Auguſtine, as I haue ſhewed in another worke, and in his 4. booke <hi>de amiſſ. gra.</hi> and 9. chap. he rendeth in peeces Hieroms ſaying.

Doctor, and compare them with the authors, and ſee who corrupt fathers. Many other teſtimonies I could produce, but I deſire not to be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious. If you could alleadge ſo many corruptions out of reuerend Iuell, I thinke we ſhould haue ſeene them. Thus I pray you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider your owne argument.</p>

I come to Papiſts who ſeeme to haue proceeded againſt their owne conſciences. One Papiſt in England, as teſtifieth Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Montanus, added to the 14. pſalme, whole ſentences, but this corruption was ſoone eſpied: this was done to prooue the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew text corrupt, and to iuſtifie the latine tranſlation approoued of Papiſts. Who almoſt but bold Papiſts durſt haue coyned ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? I thinke this is to proceede againſt conſcience. Latomus a Papiſt blaſphemed out of a pulpit, and was ſuddainly madde, and died in deſpaire. What ſhould I ſpeake of Franciſcus Spira and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Haſinmullerus giueth many examples of papiſts who haue proceeded againſt their conſciences. The bleſſed deaths of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Zwinglius, Oecolampadius, Caluin, Melancthon, Bullinger, Cranmer, Ridely, Bradford, Philpot, Iuell, Pilkington, Grindall, Dearing, and diuers other doe manifeſt that Proteſtants procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not againſt their knowledge. To returne to Papiſts, out of the forenamed author, namely Haſinmullerus, euery one may behold the ſtrange endes of theſe men. Stephanus Agricola beeing an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtata, drowned himſelfe in the ſea. One Gaſpare Franke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that he did, and wrote many things againſt his conſcience. Turrian wiſhed that he had neuer reade the Auguſtan confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, &amp;c.

            <head>The <hi>22.</hi> reaſon: Vnreuerent dealing.</head>
            <p>The Papiſts reuerence vnto God, and Chriſt is ſuch, as was that of the Iewes, who platted a crown of thornes, and put it on Chriſts head, to make him a king: euen ſo the Papiſts make Chriſt a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:19042:56"/> but they giue not the whole worke of ſaluation vnto him, which indeede is to diſhonour Chriſt. But forſooth they pretende to honour his Saints; if they doe ſoe, let them not make them Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, for this in trueth is to diſhonour them. The Saints honour conſiſteth not in falſe worſhippe, but in giuing all glorie to God. That which Lactantius writeth of Angels is true of Saints. <hi>Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum ſibi honorem tribui volunt, quorum honor in Deo eſt.</hi> They wil haue no honour giuen to them, whoſe honour is in God. We ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Saints, by praiſing God for their vertues, and by imitating them, but we make not their merits the treaſure of the Church, neither doe we call vpon them. As for reuerence vnto holy water, pictures, croſſes, images, I ſay with Eſay, who required theſe things at your hands? The Doctor in truth hauing nothing to ſay againſt vs, raileth ſpitefully, ſaying, that we enter into Churches with no greater reuerence, then men enter into Tauerns: not contenting himſelfe with this vnchriſtian lie, he proceedeth auouching, if any kneele, it is but vpon thornes, for full ſoone are they vp againe, and then with their hats vpon their heads they either iangle, or talke, or walke, as if they waited to ſee when the plaiers would come forth vpon a ſtage: or elſe theſe good fellowes goe to the alehouſe, (where now and then they finde their miniſter drinking his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning draught before he goe to his ſeruice) to drinke a pot or two of nappie ale, that thereby they may the better hold out ſeruice time. Chriſtian Reader, to recite theſe reuiling ſpeeches is to refute them, and they which frequent the alehouſe with vs are Papiſts and Atheiſts, if any Proteſtants do ſo, I wiſh them to amend, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be miniſters or laiemen. Beſides he hath many moe ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling words againſt the reuerend Biſhops, as that Barons and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men diſdaine their companie: ſurely M. Doctor I bleſſe God that you haue no ſound matter to obiect againſt the Proteſtants, but ſuch vanities as the world can controll. Our Biſhops and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are as highly eſteemed with true Chriſtians, as Popiſh Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates with their fauorites. Vertue and learning maketh a man reuerend, which, in many Popiſh Biſhopps to be wanting, we ſee with our eies. But let vs nowe ſee howe the Papiſts reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence holy things, ſpeaking of ſuch, they vſually ſay, the holy bread, the holy Scriptures, the holy Goſpell, and the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: it is well that you doe not ſo alwaies, why then doe you blame the Proteſtants, who doe ſay the holy bible, and vſe this
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19042:56"/> word holy, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is to be applied vnto things that are ſo? if they do not alwaies ſo, you can not blame them, more then your ſelues, ſeeing this word is not alwaies added by you. Marke your reaſons M. Doctor, and you ſhall finde them without this title holy. The Propheſies of the old Teſtament, Scriptures, Fathers; if this be ſuch a hainous crime, not alwaies to adde this word holy, you are guiltie of it your ſelfe. As for the French men, I thinke they doe not well to call the Saints after this manner, Mounſieor S. Peter, Maſter Saint Peter, or my Lord <hi>S.</hi> Peter: for it is no tearme of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill or temporall authoritie, but a religious and diuine honour in religion. God is our onely Lord and Maſter, and we will not giue ſaluation and redemption but onely vnto him. The compariſon which the Doctor maketh of a countriman calling her Maieſties Nobles, Treaſurer, Keeper, Admirall and ſo forth, is not worth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny anſwer, wherefore I leaue it and ſay with Bernard, <hi>Maria falſo non eget honore, honora vitae integritatem.</hi> Marie needeth no falſe honour, honour her entire life. So ſay I, honour the ſaints by imitating their vertues, the honour that I deſire to giue to ſaints is to followe their vertues.</p>

         <div n="23" type="reason">
            <head>The <hi>23.</hi> reaſon: Reſembling in Doctrine and deedes olde Heretickes.</head>
            <p>This Chapter is duely to be conſidered, becauſe we are ſaid to differ little or nothing from olde Heretickes both in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and deedes: if you could prooue this, then were the Proteſtants caſe very hard: but it ſhall be (God willing) made euident, that you reſemble olde Heretickes and not Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</p>
            <p>The firſt hereſie is, that we hold with Simon Magus; what monſtrous impudencie is this M. Doctor to charge vs will Simo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Magus his opinions? he held that men were ſaued by his grace, if they did acknowledge him the Sauiour of the world. Doe we teach any ſuch thing? we aſcribe ſaluation to no other but onely to Chriſt. If you had that conſcience which you pretend, you would not thus abuſe your ſelfe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond hereſie is, we are Nouatians, becauſe we renounce
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:19042:57"/> the Pope; I might crie out vpon theſe lewd and lowd lies. Noua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius as Philaſtrius writeth,<note place="margin">34. chap.</note> taught, <hi>Non eſſe fideli poſt Baptiſmum lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum aliquem paenitentiae.</hi> After baptiſme there was no place of repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for the faithfull.</p>
            <p>The third hereſie is, that we denie freewill, with the Manichees: but the Manichees taught that ſinne came not from freewill, but from a ſubſtance: which doctrine we renounce, and teach that we haue freewill to ſinne.<note place="margin">Lib. 1. c. 6.</note> But you deale with vs as the Pelagians dealt with the auntient Church. For Fauſtus a Pelagian charged the Church with Manichiſme, becauſe it taught the will of man to be made ſound by meere grace, and not of it ſelfe. Thus would you charge vs with Manichiſme as proud Pelagians.</p>
            <p>The fourth hereſie is, that with Arrius we denie praier for the dead. I anſwer, if Arrius tooke away thankeſgiuing for the dead, we hold not as he did; but if he denied praier for thoſe that were in fained Purgatorie, we hold no ſuch place. Philaſtrius chargeth him with condemning of marriage, and Auguſtine with Arria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme: theſe opinions we deteſt.</p>
            <p>The fift hereſie is, that we make no difference of ſinnes with Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinian, neither doe we make virginitie any better then marriage. I anſwer that we teach a difference of ſinnes, ſome to be greater, ſome to be ſmaller, but we diſclaime the opinion of veniall ſinnes. And if this be hereſie, then as I haue prooued, both fathers, and ſome papiſts are heretickes. Touching virginitie we teach with Paul, 1. Cor. 7. that pure virginitie is to be preferred before mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; although we hold that marriage is better then ſingle life, where virginitie or chaſtitie are not kept, but counterfeited.</p>
            <p>The ſixt hereſie is, that we deſpiſe all holy reliques of Saints with Vigilantius. I anſwer firſt, that Auguſtine, Philaſtrius, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, doe not reckon him amongſt heretikes. It is not eftſoone hereſy, if one man calleth it ſo. Hierom calleth Ruffinus an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike, yet M. Harding ſaith it is ſtraunge ſo to doe. Secondly I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that if Vigilantius would haue Saints reliques caſt vpon the dunghill, we hould not with him; as for tending of tapers, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp of waxe candles, Hierom imputeth it to the ſimplicitie of ſome laye men and deuoute women, that had zeale, but not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to knowledge. Thus you approoue that which Hierom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth. Laſtly S. Hierom is ſo hotte againſt Vigilantius, that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſmus is fayne to ſaie, <hi>Conuicijs debacchatur Hieronimus.</hi> Hierom
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:19042:57"/> raileth without meaſure.</p>
            <p>The ſeuenth hereſy is, that we denie with Eutyches the oblation of the ſacrifice, and the hallowing Chriſme. But therefore are we not Eutichians who confounded Chriſtes natures, and turned his humanitie into his Deitie; as for Pelagianiſme, and Donatiſme, we haue nothing to doe with them, for Pelagius denyed originall ſinne, which we teach to be in infants; and the Donatiſts held the Catholike church to be onely in Aphrica, and to haue periſhed out of the whole world: we hould noe ſuch thing. Nowe I haue finiſhed the doctrine of the ould heretckes in which chriſtian rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thou mayſt behold the ſlaunderous tonge of the Doctor, who without conſcience, when he could not charge vs truly with here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, hath inuented lies: for may part, theſe ſlaunders driue me more and more from Popery, and I beſeech thee by thy ſaluation that they way preuaile ſo with thee. Hereafter I muſt ſpeake of the deedes and manners of heretickes; firſt we are like to <hi>Paulus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſetanus,</hi> who deſired great applauſe of his hearers; for proofe that he did ſo, Euſebius is cited, but there is no ſuch thing in Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius. If this be the manner of hereticks, then are Papiſts hereticks, who, as it is manifeſt by the Doctor, deſire applauſe of men for learning, in ſo much that they breake out into their owne praiſes after a moſt inſolent manner, as for the proteſtants they doe noe ſuch thinge, and therefore they reſemble not this hereticke, if hee did ſo. Secondly we are like to the Donatiſts who ouerthrew aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars; the trueth is Chriſtian Reader, the altars which the Donatiſts deſtroied were not of ſtone as Popiſh altars are, but were tables of wood, ſuch as we haue. <hi>S.</hi> Auguſtine maketh this plaine in his 50. epiſtle. Thus M. Doctor you ſee howe your owne quotations make againſt your ſelfe. By this teſtimonie we may learne what to thinke of the popiſh ſacrifice; as for the Donatiſts refuſing to come to Councels, we doe not ſo, but vnfainedly deſire a free ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell, and haue giuen ſufficient reaſons, why we came not to the Councel of Trent. The crueltie of the Donatiſts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Catholikes, fitly agreeth to papiſts, who after a moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uadge manner haue murdered proteſtants, as the Lord wil one day make manifeſt to the world. As for Claudius <hi>de ſanctis</hi> his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie we regard it not. The reſt of the chapter concerneth the deſtroying of Idolatrie, and Luthers arrogancie, with other vaine matters, as diſputing of women, and finding fault with prieſts
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:19042:58"/> liues, but I haue anſwered ſufficiently concerning Idolatrie, and therefore it is a wicked ſlaunder, that we are like vnto Iulian the Apoſtat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, as for the diſputing of women, let Theodoret anſwer, who plainly teſtifieth that women did diſpute of diuinitie. That which the doctor counteth a fault, Theodoret approoueth of, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thou maiſt ſee our opinions to be held of women and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maides: I wiſh that women were ſo cunning in religion that they could mildly and chriſtianly diſpute of the ſame. But there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a perilous matter; ould heritikes were inquiſitiue and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to heare of the ſinnes and faults of prieſts, and of other Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall perſons: I will not ſtand to examine the trueth of this, whether heretickes were ſo inquiſitiue or no, onely knowe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Reader that this ſauoreth of Manichiſme, for the Manichees ſaid,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. de Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The papiſts would faine haue their wicked liues hidden from men, but they cannot, for as <hi>ignis tunica celari non poteſt,</hi> fire cannot be kept in the garment, ſo ſinne cannot be concealed: in vaine therefore M. Doctor, you go about to haue your faults concealed, the more you deſire this, the more men will enquire into your actions, becauſe you giue iuſt cauſe ſo to doe. Thus hauing anſwered your accuſation of hereſie, I wil ſet downe no faine, dbut true hereſies which you hould. Bellar. <hi>lib. 2. de purg. cap. 6.</hi> houldeth that it was true Samuell which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared vnto Saul, this Philaſtrius maketh an hereſie as it is plaine 26. haer. Where he prooueth that the ſoules of the righteous are in the hands of God. Secondly the prodiants did vſe the booke of Syrach, Philaſtrius <hi>haer. poſt Chriſt. 9.</hi> ſoe did the papiſts as it is manifeſt, in ſo much that they make the booke canonicall ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Thirdly the heritickes Angelici, did worſhip Angells. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. 38. haer. ſo doe the papiſts, as it is euident. Fourthly the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritickes called Apoſtolici, taught by practiſe a communitie of goods, ſo doe the Monkes, for they poſſeſſe not any thing. Fiftly, the Euthits would not labour with their hands, no more will the idle Monkes. Sixtly, the Pelagians taught that a man may fulfill the law of God, and ſo doe the Papiſts, yea they vſe the Pelagians arguments and anſwers, as I haue prooued in other places. Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenthly, the Pepulians permitted prieſthood to women. Auguſt. 27. haereſ. ſo doe the papiſts permit women to baptize. Eightly
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:19042:58"/> Carpocrates did worſhip the Images of Ieſus and of Paul, Iren. lib. 1. cap. 24. ſo doe the Papiſts. Ninthly, the heretickes called A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocryphi would not haue the Canonicall Scriptures onely to be read, but certaine Apocryphall workes. Philaſt. haereſ. 40. So the Papiſts will haue Apocryphal bookes to confirme their opinions, and to be reade for proofe of them as I haue ſhewed. Yea they fly to traditions, which the heretickes before named might alſo haue iuſtified, if the Canonicall ſcriptures had not beene ſufficient. Tenthly, the Manichees vſed but one part of the Communion, for they would not haue wine, ſo doe the Papiſts, as it is notorious to all men. I might mention many other hereſies held by Papiſts, but I haue handled them in another worke, therefore I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them here. Touching the manners of heretickes, if crueltie be a badge of heretickes, then are Papiſts rightly muſtered amongeſt heretickes, for they haue moſt barbarouſly murdered many men, as I will ſhewe (God willing) in the next reaſon.</p>

Concerning the troubles in Germanie, my purpoſe is not to ſpeake of them, neither will I meddle with the warres in Fraunce, or Scotland. Diuers countres haue diuers gouernments, the tumults of any ſubiects againſt their ſoueraignes, as we doe not allow, ſo we may not condemne the poore afflicted Chriſtians our neighbours, before we heare what they can ſay for themſelues.

Yet it is to be lamented that any ſhould be ſo obſtinate on popery, as to die in the ſame. As for Queene Elizabeths gratious gouernment, you are not aſhamed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to controll it. Yet Papiſts themſelues teach that it was both milde and mercifull: and had not her Maieſtie cauſe to deale with Papiſts as ſhee did, when the Pope excommunicated her, and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp the Northen rebels her owne ſubiects to rebell againſt her: Doctor Saunders did thruſt himſelfe into the Iriſh warres againſt her Maieſtie. If the Pope had ſo dealt with the king of Spaine, as he hath dealt with our late moſt renowmed Queene, would the king of Spaine haue taken it? When I weighed and conſidered theſe things with my ſelfe, I could not but diſlike the Romiſh religion, accompanied with tumults, inſurrections, ruines, deſolations, and with all manner of tragicall miſeries, and cleaue vnto this religion in England, which euer teacheth peace, as our writings ſhewe.

I doubt you can hardly ſhewe ſo many opinions M. Doctor, but graunt it, yet a plaine text may not bee vnderſtood of euery one, and if the text be ſo plaine as you would haue it, howe commeth it to paſſe that there are ſo many different opinions alſo among your ſelues? for you know not howe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the word (this) as I haue prooued in an other worke. Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus confeſſeth that before the Lateran councell tranſubſtantiation was no matter of faith, <hi>ergo</hi> the wordes, this is my body, prooue it not.

Vpon this vaine que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion you haue made a fooliſh inference, that we haue noe witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes at all of our newe inuented doctrine, but euery one his priuat fancy or conceit, whereas the catholike Roman religion hath all things in the world witneſſes of it. This is a monſtrous fable, are you able to prooue that all which are in heauen were the children of your church, and all that are in hell were enemies vnto it? to examine particulars: Ignatius you ſay was of your religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in Eccleſiaſticall affaires, he would not haue the king equall to the Biſhop, and becauſe he wrotte Eccleſiaſticall traditions. To the firſt I anſwer, that the true Ignatius would not correct Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ſpeech, Prou. 24. My ſonne, ſaith Salomon, honour God and the king: but I ſay, honour God and the Biſhop as high Prieſt: the true Ignatius was a man of greater religion, then that he would haue corrected the ſcripture, but any thing is good inough to patch vp poperie. To the ſecond place I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that it beeing duely conſidered ouerthroweth the Papiſts
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:19042:60"/> opinion. For Ignatius thought it neceſſarie that the Traditions of the Apoſtles, that is, their doctrine, ſhould be written for feare of corruption, what then is become of vnwritten traditions? For that this is the true meaning of Euſebius, Grynaeus ſheweth.<note place="margin">Euſ. l. 5. c. 23.</note> Next vnto Ignatius is Irenaeus placed, who is ſo farre from agni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing the Papall authoritie, that he did <hi>Acriter Victorem reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,</hi> ſharpely reprooue Victor the Romane Biſhop, becauſe he excommunicated the Churches of Aſia, for keeping the feaſt of Eaſter in a diuers manner from Rome.

               </gap> Victor, if this be your argument, he excommunicated the Churches of Aſia, <hi>ergo,</hi> he was a papiſt; you make a ridiculous reaſon. The next argument of Policarpus his going to Rome, is of the ſame moment; for who knoweth not that many mens aduiſe is vſed, who yet haue no authoritie ouer others? That Saint Cyprian, Syxtus, Laurence, with infinite others, doe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the Romane religion I denie. Saint Cyprian is ſo farre from witneſſing all points of poperie, that as I haue prooued, he is reiected of Papiſts. From men, the Doctor commeth to women, affirming thouſands to haue defended their virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie againſt deuils, and men. What then, were they Papiſts therefore? To come to ſpeciallities, Helen you ſay founde out the Croſſe. Although that hiſtorie may be doubted of, yet Helen was no Papiſt, for ſhee did not worſhippe the croſſe, becauſe that was an heatheniſh errour; if ſhee had beene a Papiſt ſhee would haue adored the croſſe. But the Mother of Auguſtine, Saint Monica, was a papiſt, who after death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted that ſhee might haue Maſſe ſaid for her: here if you meane popiſh Maſſe M. Doctor, you abuſe your ſelfe moſt ſhamefully, for ſhee deſired onely a memorie of her at the Communion. So had the Prophets and Apoſtles, which were not in your fained Purgatorie. By theſe fewe examples, you haue prooued Proteſtancie, then poperie; as for the reſt which you name, Saint Paul the Eremit, and others, when you prooue them Papiſts, we will beleeue it. To your queſtion, demanding whether there were any Saints in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, before this our age, which were not papiſts? I anſwer that there were, &amp; therfore you ſpeake impiouſly, to ſay that heauen was emptie, vntil Luther ſhooke off his hood, or if there were any they were Papiſts, who reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

This iolly fellowe, knoweth not onely matters in heauen, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo what is done in hell as it ſeemeth. The heathen perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are in hell for perſecuting the Catholike Church I doubt not, but this Catholike Church is not the ſame with the Romiſh Church at this day, there is ample difference betwixt theſe. And that Conſtantine gaue great peace to the Church,<note place="margin">Theod. lib. 1. c. 7.</note> it is true alſo, but he was no Papiſt, for he ſaith that the holy Scriptures teach vs plainely all things which concerne diuine matters. Laſtly that all Biſhops vnder the cope of heauen were members of this Romiſh Church, is a notorious vntrueth. The Doctor to fill vp his reaſon numbreth many, but prooueth not that which he ſaith. The reſt of the chapter is but a vaine flouriſh of words, in which I take no delight. To drawe his reaſon into a ſyllogiſme is needleſſe, becauſe in deede it hath neither head nor foote. Amongeſt many vanities, in the ende of the chapter the Doctor ſaith, that he is a Papiſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Romiſh religion is the moſt beneficiall of all the reſt. Chriſtian Reader, I feare me that this indeed is the true cauſe why many are papiſts, namely their commodities.
